<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Plutarch</span> takes notice of a very remarkable law
of Solon&#8217;s,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> &#8220;which declared every man infamous,
who, in any sedition or civil dissension in the state,
should continue neuter, and refuse to side with
either party.&#8221; Aulus Gellius,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> who gives a more
circumstantial detail of this uncommon law, affirms
the penalty to be &#8220;no less than confiscation of all the
effects, and banishment of the delinquent.&#8221; Cicero
mentions the same law to his friend Atticus,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and
even makes the punishment capital, though he resolves
at the same time not to conform to it under
his present circumstances, unless his friend should
advise him to the contrary.</p>

<p>Which of these relators has given us the real
penalty annexed to this law by Solon, is scarce worth
our inquiry. But I cannot help observing, that
strange as this law may appear at first sight, yet if
we reflect upon the reasons of it, as they are assigned
by Plutarch and A. Gellius, it will not appear unworthy
of that great legislator.</p>

<p>The opinion of Plutarch is; &#8220;that Solon intended
no citizen, as soon as ever he had provided for the
security of his own private affairs, should be so
unfeeling with respect to the publick welfare, as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">ii</a></span>
affect a brutal insensibility,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> and not to sympathize
with the distress and calamities of his country: but
that he should immediately join the honester and
juster party; and rather risque his all in defence of
the side he had espoused, than keep aloof from danger
until he saw which party proved the stronger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reason given by A. Gellius is more striking,
and less liable to objections than that of Plutarch.
&#8220;If (says that writer) all the good men in any state,
when they find themselves too weak to stem the
torrent of a furious divided populace, and unable to
suppress a sedition at its first breaking out, should
immediately divide, and throw themselves into the
opposite sides, the event in such a case would be
that each party, which they had differently espoused,
would naturally begin to cool, and put themselves
under their direction, as persons of the greatest
weight and authority: thus it would be greatly in the
power of such men so circumstanced, to reconcile
all differences, and restore peace and union, while
they mutually restrained and moderated the fury of
their own party, and convinced the opposite side,
that they sincerely wished and laboured for their
safety, not for their destruction.&#8221;</p>

<p>What effect this law had in the Athenian state is
no where mentioned. However, as it is plainly
founded upon that relation which every member
bears to the body politick, and that interest which
every individual is supposed to have in the good of
the whole community; it is still, though not in express
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">iii</a></span>
terms, yet virtually received in every free
country. For those who continue neuter in any civil
dissension, under the denomination of moderate men,
who keep aloof and wait quietly in order to follow
the fortune of the prevailing side, are generally
stigmatized with the opprobious name of <i>time servers</i>,
and consequently neither esteemed, nor trusted by
either party.</p>

<p>As our own country is blessed with the greatest
share of liberty, so is it more subject to civil dissensions
than any other nation in Europe. Every man
is a politician, and warmly attached to his respective
party; and this law of Solon&#8217;s seems to take place as
strongly in Britain, as ever it did in the most factious
times at Athens. Freedom of thought, or the liberty
of the mind, arises naturally from the very essence
of our constitution; and the liberty of the press, that
peculiar privilege of the British subject, gives every
man a continual opportunity of laying his sentiments
before the publick. Would our political writers pursue
the salutary intention of Solon, as delivered to us by
A. Gellius in his explication of that extraordinary
law, they might contribute greatly to the establishment
of that harmony and union, which can alone
preserve and perpetuate the duration of our constitution.
But the opposite views and interests of parties
make the altercation endless; and the victory
over an antagonist is generally the aim, whilst the
investigation of truth only, ought ever to be the real
end proposed in all controversial inquiries. The
points which have lately exercised so many pens,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
turn upon the present expediency, or absolute insignificancy,
of a <i>militia</i>; or, what principles conduce
most to the power, the happiness, and the duration
of a free people. The dispute has been carried on,
not only with warmth, but even with virulence. The
chicane of sophistry has been employed, whilst
indecent personal reflections, and the unfair charge
of disaffection, have been too often made use of to
supply the defect of argument, and to prejudice the
reader, where they despaired of confuting the writer.
Historical facts have been either misrepresented, or
ascribed to wrong principles; the history of ancient
nations has been quoted in general terms, without
marking the different periods distinguished by some
memorable change in the manners or constitution of
the same people, which will ever make a wide difference
in the application.</p>

<p>Anxious after truth, and unsatisfied with so many
bold assertions destitute of all proof but the writer&#8217;s
word, which I daily met with, I determined coolly
and impartially to examine the evidence arising from
ancient history, which both sides so frequently appealed
to: for bare speculative reasoning is no more
conclusive in political inquiries than in physical.
Facts and experience alone must decide: and political
facts and experience must alone be learned from
history. Determined therefore to judge for myself,
I carefully read over the histories of the most celebrated
republicks of antiquity in their original languages,
unbiased either by comments or translations;
a part of history of all others the most instructive,
and most interesting to an Englishman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span></p>

<p>As instruction was the sole end of my inquiries, I
here venture to offer the result of them to the candour
of the publick, since my only motive for writing was
a most ardent concern for the welfare of my country.
The design therefore of these papers is, to warn my
countrymen, by the example of others, of the fatal
consequences which must inevitably attend our intestine
divisions at this critical juncture; and to inculcate
the necessity of that national union, upon which the
strength, the security, and the duration of a free
state must eternally depend. Happy, if my weak
endeavours could in the least contribute to an end
so salutary, so truly desirable!</p>

<p>In the numerous quotations from the Greek and
Latin historians, which are unavoidable in a treatise
of this nature, I have endeavoured to give the
genuine sense and meaning of the author, to the best
of my abilities. But as every reader has an equal
right of judging for himself, I have subjoined in the
margin, the original words of the author, with the
book, page, name, and date of the respective edition,
I made use of, for the ease as well as the satisfaction
of the candid and judicious: for that vague and
careless manner, which some writers affect, of quoting
an author by name only, without specifying the
particular passage referred to in evidence, is neither
useful, nor satisfactory to the generality of readers;
whilst the unfair method, too often practised, of quoting
disjointed scraps, or unconnected sentences, is
apt to raise strong suspicions, that the real sentiments
and intention of the author are kept out of sight,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
and that the writer is endeavouring to palm false
evidence upon his readers.</p>

<p>I must take the liberty of offering another reason,
which, I confess, was of more weight with me,
because more personally interesting. As the British
state and the ancient free republicks were founded
upon the same principles, and their policy and constitution
nearly similar, so, as like causes will ever
produce like effects, it is impossible not to perceive
an equal resemblance between their and our manners,
as they and we equally deviated from those
first principles. Unhappily, the resemblance between
the manners of our own times, and the manners of
those republicks in their most degenerate periods,
is, in many respects, so striking, that unless the
words in the original were produced as vouchers,
any well-meaning reader, unacquainted with those
historians, would be apt to treat the descriptions of
those periods, which he may frequently meet with,
as licentious, undistinguished satire upon the present
age.</p>

<p>The behaviour of some of our political writers
makes an apology of this nature in some measure
necessary; on the one hand, that I may avoid the
imputation of pedantry, or being thought fond of an
idle ostentatious parade of learning; on the other,
<i>lest a work calculated to promote domestick peace and
union, should be strained, by the perverseness of party
construction, into an inflammatory libel</i>.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> not at all surprised at those encomiums which
the philosophers and poets so lavishly bestow upon
the pleasures of a country retirement. The profusion
of varying beauties, which attend the returning
seasons, furnishes out new and inexhaustible subjects
for the entertainment of the studious and contemplative.
Even winter carries charms for the philosophick
eye, and equally speaks the stupendous power
of the great author of nature. To search out and
adore the Creator through his works, is our primary
duty, and claims the first place in every rational
mind. To promote the publick good of the community
of which we are born members, in proportion
to our situation and abilities, is our secondary
duty as men and citizens. I judged therefore a close
attention to the study of history the most useful
way of employing that time which my country
recess afforded, as it would enable me to fulfil this
obligation: and upon this principle I take the liberty
of offering these papers as my mite towards the
publick good.</p><p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of these researches nothing gave me
so much pleasure as the study of ancient history:
because it made me so truly sensible of the inestimable
value of our own constitution, when I observed
the very different maxims and conduct, and the
strong contrast between the founders of despotick
monarchies, and the legislators of the free states of
antiquity. In the former, that absurd and impious
doctrine of millions created for the sole use and
pleasure of one individual, seems to have been the
first position in their politicks, and the general rule
of their conduct. The latter fixed the basis of their
respective states upon this just and benevolent plan,
&#8220;that the safety and happiness of the whole community
was the only end of all government.&#8221; The
former treated mankind as brutes, and lorded it over
them by force. The latter received them as their
fellow-creatures, and governed them by reason:
hence whilst we detest the former as the enemies
and destroyers; we cannot help admiring and revering
the latter, as the lovers and benefactors of
mankind.</p>

<p>The histories which I considered with the greatest
attention, gave me the highest entertainment, and
affected me most, were those of the free states of
Greece, Carthage, and Rome. I saw with admiration
the profound wisdom and sagacity, the unwearied
labour and disinterested spirit of those amiable and
generous men, who contributed most towards forming
those states, and settling them upon the firmest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
foundations. I traced with pleasure their gradual
progress towards that height of power, to which in
process of time they arrived; and I remarked the
various steps and degrees by which they again
declined, and at last sunk gradually into their final
dissolution, not without a just mixture of sorrow and
indignation.</p>

<p>It would be a labour of more curiosity, than of
real use at this time, to give a long detail of the
original formation of those states, and the wise laws
and institutions by which they were raised to that
envied degree of perfection; yet a concise account
of the primitive constitution of each state may be so
far necessary, as it will render the deviations from
that constitution more intelligible, and more fully
illustrate the causes of their final subversion. But
to point out and expose the principal causes, which
contributed gradually to weaken, and at length
demolish and level with the ground, those beautiful
fabricks raised by the publick virtue, and cemented
by the blood of so many illustrious patriots, will, in
my opinion, be more interesting and more instructive.</p>

<p>When I consider the constitution of our own
country, I cannot but think it the best calculated for
promoting the happiness, and preserving the lives,
liberty, and property of mankind, of any yet recorded
in profane history. I am persuaded too, that our
wise ancestors, who first formed it, adopted whatever
they judged most excellent and valuable in those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
states when in their greatest perfection; and did all
that human wisdom could do for rendering it durable,
and transmitting it pure and entire to future generations.
But as all things under the sun are subject
to change, and children are too apt to forget and
degenerate from the virtues of their fathers, there
seems great reason to fear, that what has happened
to those free states may at length prove the melancholy
fate of our own country; especially when we
reflect, that the same causes, which contributed to
their ruin, operate at this time so very strongly
amongst us. As I thought therefore that it might
be of some use to my country at this dangerous
crisis, I have selected the interesting examples
of those once free and powerful nations, who by
totally deviating from those principles upon which
they were originally founded, lost first their liberty,
and at last their very existence, so far as to leave
no other vestiges remaining of them as a people,
but what are to be found in the records of history.</p>

<p>It is an undoubted truth, that our own constitution
has at different times suffered very severe shocks,
and been reduced more than once to the very point
of ruin: but because it has hitherto providentially
escaped, we are not to flatter ourselves that opportunities
of recovery will always offer. To me therefore
the method of proof drawn from example, seemed
more striking, as well as more level to every capacity,
than all speculative reasoning: for as the same
causes will, by the stated laws of sublunary affairs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
sooner or later invariably produce the same effects,
so whenever we see the same maxims of government
prevail, the same measures pursued, and the same
coincidences of circumstances happen in our own
country, which brought on, and attend the subversion
of those states, we may plainly read our own
fate in their catastrophe, unless we apply speedy and
effectual remedies, before our case is past recovery.
It is the best way to learn wisdom in time from the
fate of others; and if examples will not instruct and
make us wiser, I confess myself utterly at a loss to
know what will.</p>

<p>In my reflections, which naturally arose in the
course of these researches, truth and impartiality
have been my only guides. I have endeavoured to
show the principal causes of that degeneracy of
manners, which reduced those once brave and free
people into the most abject slavery. I have marked
the alarming progress which the same evils have
already made, and still continue to make amongst us,
with that honest freedom which is the birthright of
every Englishman. My sole aim is to excite those
who have the welfare of their country at heart, to
unite their endeavours in opposing the fatal tendency
of those evils, whilst they are within the power of
remedy. With this view, and this only, I have
marked out the remote as well as immediate causes
of the ruin of those states, as so many beacons warning

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />

<small>OF THE REPUBLICK OF SPARTA.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the free states of Greece were at first monarchical,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
and seem to owe their liberty rather to
the injudicious oppressions of their respective kings,
than to any natural propensity in the people to alter
their form of government. But as they had smarted
so severely under an excess of power lodged in the
hands of one man, they were too apt to run into the
other extreme, democracy; a state of government
the most subject of all others to disunion and faction.</p>

<p>Of all the Grecian states, that of Sparta seems to
have been the most unhappy, before their government
was new modelled by Lycurgus. The authority
of their kings and their laws (as Plutarch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
informs us) were alike trampled upon and despised.
Nothing could restrain the insolence of the headstrong
encroaching populace; and the whole government
sunk into anarchy and confusion. From this
deplorable situation the wisdom and virtue of one
great man raised his country to that height of
power, which was the envy and the terror of her
neighbours. A convincing proof how far the influence
of one great and good man will operate
towards reforming the most bold licentious people,
when he has once thoroughly acquired their esteem
and confidence! Upon this principle Lycurgus
founded his plan of totally altering and new moulding
the constitution of his country. A design, all
circumstances considered, the most daring, and the
most happily executed, of any yet immortalized in
history.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>Lycurgus succeeded to the moiety of the crown
of Sparta at the death of his elder brother; but his
brother&#8217;s widow declaring herself with child, and
that child proving to be a son, he immediately resigned
the regal dignity to the new born infant, and
governed as protector and guardian of the young
prince during his minority. The generous and disinterested
behaviour of Lycurgus upon this occasion
endeared him greatly to the people; who had already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
experienced the happy effect of his wise and equitable
administration. But to avoid the malice of the
queen-mother and her faction, who accused him of
designs upon the crown, he prudently quitted both
the government and his country. In his travels during
this voluntary exile, he drew up and thoroughly
digested his great scheme of reformation. He
visited all those states which at that time were most
eminent for the wisdom of their laws, or the form of
their constitution. He carefully observed all the
different institutions, and the good or bad effects
which they respectively produced on the manners of
each people. He took care to avoid what he judged
to be defects; but selected whatever he found calculated
to promote the happiness of a people; and
with these materials he formed his so much celebrated
plan of legislation, which he very soon had
an opportunity of reducing to practice. For the
Spartans, thoroughly sensible of the difference between
the administration of Lycurgus and that of
their kings, not only earnestly wished for his presence,
but sent repeated deputations to entreat him
to return, and free them from those numerous
disorders under which their country at that time
laboured. As the request of the people was unanimous,
and the kings no ways opposed his return,
he judged it the critical time for the execution of his
scheme. For he found affairs at home in the distracted
situation they had been represented, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
whole body of the people in a disposition proper for
his purpose.</p>

<p>Lycurgus began his reform with a change in the
constitution, which at that time consisted of a confused
medley of hereditary monarchy divided between
two families, and a disorderly democracy, utterly
destitute of the balance of a third intermediate power,
a circumstance so essential to the duration of all
mixed governments. To remedy this evil, he established
a senate with such a degree of power, as
might fix them the inexpugnable barrier of the constitution
against the encroachments either of kings
or people. The crown of Sparta had been long
divided between two families descended originally
from the same ancestor, who jointly enjoyed the
succession. But though Lycurgus was sensible that
all the mischiefs which had happened to the state,
arose from this absurd division of the regal power,
yet he made no alteration as to the succession of the
two families. Any innovation in so nice a point might
have proved an endless source of civil commotions,
from the pretensions of that line which should happen
to be excluded. He therefore left them the title
and the ensignia of royalty, but limited their authority,
which he confined to the business of war and
religion. To the people he gave the privilege of
electing the senators, and giving their sanction to
those laws which the kings and senate should approve.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>When Lycurgus had regulated the government,
he undertook a task more arduous than any of the
fabled labours of Hercules. This was to new mould
his countrymen, by extirpating all the destructive
passions, and raising them above every weakness
and infirmity of human nature. A scheme which all
the great philosophers had taught in theory, but
none except Lycurgus was ever able to reduce to
practice.</p>

<p>As he found the two extremes, of great wealth
and great indigence, were the source of infinite mischiefs
in a free state, he divided the lands of the
whole territory into equal lots proportioned to the
number of the inhabitants. He appointed publick
tables, at which he enjoined all the citizens to eat
together without distinction; and he subjected every
man, even the kings themselves, to a fine if they
should violate this law by eating at their own houses.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
Their diet was plain, simple, and regulated by the
law, and distributed amongst the guests in equal
portions. Every member was obliged monthly to
contribute his quota for the provision of his respective
table. The conversation allowed at these
publick repasts, turned wholly upon such subjects as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
tended most to improve the minds of the younger
sort in the principles of wisdom and virtue. Hence,
as Xenophon observes, they were schools not only
for temperance and sobriety, but also for instruction.
Thus Lycurgus introduced a perfect equality amongst
his countrymen. The highest and the lowest fared
alike as to diet, were all lodged and clothed alike,
without the least variation either in fashion or
materials.</p>

<p>When by these means he had exterminated every
species of luxury, he next removed all temptation to
the acquisition of wealth, that fatal source of the
innumerable evils which prevailed in every other
country. He effected this with his usual policy, by
forbidding the currency of gold and silver money,
and substituting an iron coinage of great weight and
little value, which continued the only current coin
through the whole Spartan dominions for several
ages.</p>

<p>To bar up the entrance of wealth, and guard his
citizens against the contagion of corruption, he absolutely
prohibited navigation and commerce, though
his country contained a large extent of sea coast furnished
with excellent harbours. He allowed as little
intercourse as possible with foreigners, nor suffered
any of his countrymen to visit the neighbouring
states, unless when the publick business required it,
lest they should be infected with their vices. Agriculture,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
and such mechanick trades as were absolutely
necessary for their subsistence, he confined
to their slaves the Helots; but he banished all those
arts which tended either to debase the mind, or enervate
the body. Musick he encouraged, and poetry
he admitted, but both subject to the inspection of
the magistrates.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Thus by the equal partition of
the lands, and the abolition of gold and silver money,
he at once preserved his country from luxury,
avarice, and all those evils which arise from an irregular
indulgence of the passions, as well as all contentions
about property, with their consequence,
vexatious lawsuits.</p>

<p>To ensure the observance of his laws to the latest
posterity, he next formed proper regulations for the
education of their children, which he esteemed one
of the greatest duties of a legislator. His grand
maxim was &#8220;that children were the property of
the state, to whom alone their education was to be
intrusted.&#8221; In their first infancy, the nurses were
instructed to indulge them neither in their diet, nor
in those little froward humours which are so peculiar
to that age; to inure them to bear cold and fasting;
to conquer their first fears by accustoming them to
solitude and darkness; and to prepare them for that
stricter state of discipline, to which they were soon
to be initiated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>When arrived at the age of seven years, they were
taken from the nurses, and placed in their proper
classes. The diet and clothing of all were the same,
just sufficient to support nature, and defend them
from the inclemency of the seasons; and they all
lodged alike in the same dormitory on beds of reeds,
to which for the sake of warmth they were all
allowed in winter to add the down of thistles. Their
sports and exercises were such as contributed to
render their limbs supple, and their bodies compact
and firm. They were accustomed to run up the
steepest rocks barefoot; and swimming, dancing,
hunting, boxing, and wrestling, were their constant
diversions. Lycurgus was equally solicitous in training
up the youth to a habit of passive courage as
well as active. They were taught to despise pain
no less than danger, and to bear the severest
scourgings with the most invincible constancy and
resolution. For to flinch under the strokes, or to
exhibit the least sign of any sense of pain, was
deemed highly infamous.</p>

<p>Nor were the minds of the Spartan youth cultivated
with less care. Their learning, as Plutarch informs
us, was sufficient for their occasions, for Lycurgus
admitted nothing but what was truly useful. They
carefully instilled into their tender minds the great
duties of religion, and the sacred indispensable obligation
of an oath, and trained them up in the best of
sciences, the principles of wisdom and virtue. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
love of their country seemed to be almost innate;
and this leading maxim, &#8220;that every Spartan was
the property of his country, and had no right over
himself,&#8221; was by the force of education incorporated
into their very nature.</p>

<p>When they arrived to manhood they were enrolled
in their militia, and allowed to be present in their
publick assemblies: privileges which only subjected
them to a different discipline. For the employments
and way of living of the citizens of Sparta were fixed,
and settled by as strict regulations as in an army
upon actual service. When they took the field,
indeed, the rigour of their discipline with respect to
diet and the ornament of their persons was much
softened, so that the Spartans were the only people
in the universe, to whom the toils of war afforded
ease and relaxation. In fact, Lycurgus&#8217;s plan of
civil government was evidently designed to preserve
his country free and independent, and to form the
minds of his citizens for the enjoyment of that rational
and manly happiness, which can find no place
in a breast enslaved by the pleasures of the senses,
or ruffled by the passions; and the military regulations
which he established, were as plainly calculated
for the protection of his country from the encroachments
of her ambitious neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> For he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
left no alternative to his people, but death or victory;
and he laid them under a necessity of observing those
regulations, by substituting the valour of the inhabitants
in the place of walls and fortifications for the
defence of their city.</p>

<p>If we reflect that human nature is at all times and
in all places the same, it seems to the last degree
astonishing, how Lycurgus could be able to introduce
such a self-denying plan of discipline amongst
a disorderly licentious people: a scheme, which not
only levelled at once all distinction, as to property,
between the richest and the poorest individual, but
compelled the greatest persons in the state to submit
to a regimen which allowed only the bare necessaries
of life, excluding every thing which in the
opinion of mankind seems essential to its comforts
and enjoyments. I observed before that he had
secured the esteem and confidence of his countrymen,
and there was, besides, at that time a very
lucky concurrence of circumstances in his favour.
The two kings were men of little spirit, and less
abilities, and the people were glad to exchange their
disorderly state for any settled form of government.
By his establishment of a senate consisting of thirty
persons who held their seats for life, and to whom
he committed the supreme power in civil affairs, he
brought the principal nobility into his scheme, as
they naturally expected a share in a government
which they plainly saw inclined so much to an aristocracy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Even the two kings very readily accepted
seats in his senate, to secure some degree of authority.
He awed the people into obedience by the sanction
he procured for his scheme from the oracle at
Delphos, whose decisions were, at that time, revered
by all Greece as divine and infallible. But the
greatest difficulty he had to encounter was to procure
the equal partition of the lands. The very first proposal
met with so violent an opposition from the men
of fortune, that a fray ensued, in which Lycurgus
lost one of his eyes. But the people, struck with the
sight of the blood of this admired legislator, seized
the offender, one Alcander, a young man of a hot,
but not disingenuous disposition, and gave him up to
Lycurgus to be punished at discretion. But the
humane and generous behaviour of Lycurgus quickly
made a convert of Alcander, and wrought such a
change, that from an enemy he became his greatest
admirer and advocate with the people.</p>

<p>Plutarch and the rest of the Greek historians leave
us greatly in the dark as to the means by which
Lycurgus was able to make so bitter a pill, as the
division of property, go down with the wealthy part
of his countrymen. They well us indeed, that he
carried his point by the gentle method of reasoning
and persuasion, joined to that religious awe which
the divine sanction of the oracle impressed so deeply
on the minds of the citizens. But the cause, in my
opinion, does not seem equal to the effect. For the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
furious opposition which the rich made to the very
first motion for such a distribution of property,
evinces plainly, that they looked upon the responses
of the oracle as mere priestcraft, and treated it as
the <i>esprits-forts</i> have done religion in modern times;
I mean as a state engine fit only to be played off upon
the common people. It seems most probable, in my
opinion, that as he effected the change in the constitution
by the distribution of the supreme power
amongst the principal persons, when he formed his
senate; so the equal partition of property was the
bait thrown out to bring over the body of the people
entirely to his interest. I should rather think that
he compelled the rich to submit to so grating a measure,
by the assistance of the poorer citizens, who
were vastly the majority.</p>

<p>As soon as Lycurgus had thoroughly settled his
new polity, and by his care and assiduity imprinted
his laws so deeply in the minds and manners of his
countrymen, that he judged the constitution able to
support itself, and stand upon its own bottom, his
last scheme was to fix, and perpetuate its duration
down to latest posterity, as far as human prudence
and human means could effect it. To bring his
scheme to bear, he had again recourse to the same
pious artifice which had succeeded so well in the
beginning. He told the people in a general assembly,
that he could not possibly put the finishing
stroke to his new establishment, which was the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
essential point, until he had again consulted the
oracle. As they all expressed the greatest eagerness
for his undertaking the journey, he laid hold of so
fair an opportunity to bind the kings, senate, and
people, by the most solemn oaths, to the strict
observance of his new form of government, and
not to attempt the least alteration in any one particular
until his return from Delphos. He had now
completed the great design which he had long in
view, and bid an eternal adieu to his country.
The question he put to the oracle was &#8220;whether
the laws he had already established, were rightly
formed to make and preserve his countrymen virtuous
and happy?&#8221; The answer he received was
just as favourable as he desired. It was &#8220;that his
laws were excellently well calculated for that purpose;
and that Sparta should continue to be the
most renowned city in the world, as long as her
citizens persisted in the observance of the laws of
Lycurgus.&#8221; He transmitted both the question and
the answer home to Sparta in writing, and devoted the
remainder of his life to voluntary banishment. The
accounts in history of the end of this great man are
very uncertain. Plutarch affirms, that as his resolution
was never to release his countrymen from the
obligation of the oath he had laid them under, he put
a voluntary end to his life at Delphos by fasting.
Plutarch extols the death of Lycurgus in very pompous
terms, as a most unexampled instance of heroic
patriotism, since he bequeathed, as he terms it, his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
death to his country, as the perpetual guardian to that
happiness, which he had procured for them during
his lifetime. Yet the same historian acknowledges
another tradition, that Lycurgus ended his days in
the island of Crete, and desired, as his last request,
that his body should be burnt, and his ashes thrown
into the sea;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> lest, if his remains should at any time
be carried back to Sparta, his countrymen might look
upon themselves as released from their oath as much
as if he had returned alive, and be induced to alter
his form of government. I own, I prefer this latter
account, as more agreeable to the genius and policy
of that wise and truly disinterested legislator.</p>

<p>The Spartans, as Plutarch asserts, held the first
rank in Greece for discipline and reputation full five
hundred years, by strictly adhering to the laws of
Lycurgus; which not one of their kings ever infringed
for fourteen successions quite down to the
reign of the first Agis. For he will not allow the
creation of those magistrates called the ephori, to be
any innovation in the constitution, since he affirms
it to have been, &#8220;not a relaxation, but an extension,
of the civil polity.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> But notwithstanding the
gloss thrown over the institution of the ephori by
this nice distinction of Plutarch&#8217;s, it certainly induced
as fatal a change into the Spartan constitution,
as the tribuneship of the people, which was formed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
upon that model, did afterwards into the Roman.
For instead of enlarging and strengthening the aristocratical
power, as Plutarch asserts, they gradually
usurped the whole government, and formed themselves
into a most tyrannical oligarchy.</p>

<p>The ephori (a Greek word signifying inspectors
or overseers) were five in number, and elected
annually by the people out of their own body.
The exact time of the origin of this institution
and of the authority annexed to their office, is
quite uncertain. Herodotus ascribes it to Lycurgus;
Xenophon to Lycurgus jointly with the principal
citizens of Sparta. Aristotle and Plutarch fix it under
the reign of Theopompus and Polydorus, and attribute
the institution expressly to the former of those
princes about one hundred and thirty years after the
death of Lycurgus. I cannot but subscribe to this
opinion as the most probable, because the first political
contest we meet with at Sparta happened under
the reign of those princes, when the people endeavoured
to extend their privileges beyond the limits
prescribed by Lycurgus. But as the joint opposition
of the kings and senate was equally warm, the creation
of this magistracy out of the body of the people,
seems to have been the step taken at that time to
compromise the affair, and restore the publick tranquility:
a measure which the Roman senate copied
afterwards, in the erection of the tribuneship, when
their people mutinied, and made that memorable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
secession to the <i>mons sacer</i>. I am confirmed in this
opinion by the relation which Aristotle gives us of
a remarkable dispute between Theopompus and his
wife upon that occasion.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> The queen much dissatisfied
with the institution of the ephori, reproached her
husband greatly for submitting to such a diminution
of the regal authority, and asked him if he was not
ashamed to transmit the crown to his posterity so
much weaker and worse circumstanced, than he received
it from his father. His answer, which is
recorded amongst the laconick <i>bons mots</i>, was, &#8220;no,
for I transmit it more lasting.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> But the event showed
that the lady was a better politician, as well as truer
prophet, than her husband. Indeed the nature of
their office, the circumstances of their election, and
the authority they assumed, are convincing proofs
that their office was first extorted, and their power
afterwards gradually extended, by the violence of
the people, irritated too probably by the oppressive
behaviour of the kings and senate. For whether their
power extended no farther than to decide, when the
two kings differed in opinion, and to overrule in
favour of him whose sentiments should be most conducive
to the publick interest, as we are told by Plutarch
in the life of Agis; or whether they were at
first only select friends, whom the kings appointed
as deputies in their absence, when they were both
compelled to take the field together in their long wars
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
with the Messenians, as the same author tells us by
the mouth of his hero Cleomenes, is a point, which
history does not afford us light enough to determine.
This however is certain, from the concurrent voice
of all the ancient historians, that at last they not only
seized upon every branch of the administration, but
assumed the power of imprisoning, deposing, and
even putting their kings to death by their own
authority. The kings too, in return, sometimes
bribed, sometimes deposed or murdered the ephori,
and employed their whole interest to procure such
persons to be elected, as they judged would be most
tractable. I look therefore on the creation of the
ephori as a breach in the Spartan constitution, which
proved the first inlet to faction and corruption. For
that these evils took rise from the institution of the
ephori is evident from the testimony of Aristotle,
&#8220;who thought it extremely impolitick to elect magistrates,
vested with the supreme power in the state,
out of the body of the people;<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> because it often happened,
that men extremely indigent were raised in
this manner to the helm, whom their very poverty
tempted to become venal. For the ephori, as he
affirms, had not only been frequently guilty of bribery
before his time, but, even at the very time he wrote,
some of those magistrates, corrupted by money, used
their utmost endeavours, at the publick repasts, to
accomplish the destruction of the whole city. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
adds too, that as their power was so great as to
amount to a perfect tyranny, the kings themselves
were necessitated to court their favour by such
methods as greatly hurt the constitution, which from
an aristocracy degenerated into an absolute democracy.
For that magistracy alone had engrossed
the whole government.&#8221;</p>

<p>From these remarks of the judicious Aristotle, it
is evident that the ephori had totally destroyed the
balance of power established by Lycurgus. From
the tyranny therefore of this magistracy proceeded
those convulsions which so frequently shook the
state of Sparta, and at last gradually brought on its
total subversion. But though this fatal alteration in
the Spartan constitution must be imputed to the
intrigues of the ephori and their faction, yet it
could never, in my opinion, have been effected without
a previous degeneracy in their manners; which
must have been the consequence of some deviation
from the maxims of Lycurgus.</p>

<p>It appears evidently from the testimony of Polybius
and Plutarch, that the great scheme of the
Spartan legislator was, to provide for the lasting
security of his country against all foreign invasions,
and to perpetuate the blessings of liberty and independency
to the people. By the generous plan of
discipline which he established, he rendered his
countrymen invincible at home. By banishing gold
and silver, and prohibiting commerce and the use
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
of shipping, he proposed to confine the Spartans
within the limits of their own territories; and by
taking away the means, to repress all desires of
making conquests upon their neighbours. But the
same love of glory and of their country which
made them so terrible in the field, quickly produced
ambition and a lust of domination; and ambition
as naturally opened the way for avarice and corruption.
For Polybius truly observes, that as
long as they extended their views no farther than
the dominion over their neighbouring states, the
produce of their own country was sufficient for what
supplies they had occasion for in such short excursions.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
But when, in direct violation of the laws of
Lycurgus, they began to undertake more distant
expeditions both by sea and land, they quickly felt
the want of a publick fund to defray their extraordinary
expenses. For they found by experience,
that neither their iron money, nor their method of
trucking the annual produce of their own lands for
such commodities as they wanted (which was the
only traffick allowed by the laws of Lycurgus) could
possibly answer their demands upon those occasions.
Hence their ambition, as the same historian remarks,
laid them under the scandalous necessity of paying
servile court to the Persian monarchs for pecuniary
supplies and subsidies, to impose heavy tributes upon
the conquered islands, and to exact money from the
other Grecian states, as occasions required.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>Historians unanimously agree, that wealth with its
attendants, luxury and corruption, gained admission
at Sparta in the reign of the first Agis. Lysander,
alike a hero and a politician; a man of the greatest
abilities and the greatest dishonesty that Sparta ever
produced; rapacious after money, which at the same
time he despised, and a slave only to ambition, was
the author of an innovation so fatal to the manners
of his countrymen. After he had enabled his country
to give law to all Greece by his conquest of Athens,
he sent home that immense mass of wealth, which
the plunder of so many states had put into his possession.
The most sensible men amongst the Spartans,
dreading the fatal consequences of this capital
breach of the institutions of their legislator, protested
strongly before the ephori against the introduction
of gold and silver, as pests destructive to
the publick. The ephori referred it to the decision
of the senate, who, dazzled with the lustre of that
money, to which until that time they had been utter
strangers, decreed &#8220;that gold and silver money might
be admitted for the service of the state; but made
it death, if any should ever be found in the possession
of a private person.&#8221; This decision Plutarch censures
as weak and sophistical.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> As if Lycurgus
was only afraid simply of money, and not of that
dangerous love of money which is generally its
concomitant; a passion which was so far from being
rooted out by the restraint laid upon private persons,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
that it was rather inflamed by the esteem and value
which was set upon money by the publick. Thus,
as he justly remarks, whilst they barred up the
houses of private citizens against the entrance of
wealth by the terror and safeguard of the law, they
left their minds more exposed to the love of money
and the influence of corruption, by raising an universal
admiration and desire of it, as something
great and respectable. The truth of this remark
appears by the instance given us by Plutarch, of one
Thorax, a great friend of Lysander&#8217;s, who was put
to death by the ephori, upon proof that a quantity of
silver had been actually found in his possession.</p>

<p>From that time Sparta became venal, and grew
extremely fond of subsidies from foreign powers.
Agesilaus, who succeeded Agis, and was one of the
greatest of their kings, behaved in the latter part
of his life more like the captain of a band of mercenaries,
than a king of Sparta. He received a large
subsidy from Tachos, at that time king of Egypt,
and entered into his service with a body of troops
which he had raised for that purpose. But when
Nectanabis, who had rebelled against his uncle
Tachos, offered him more advantageous terms, he
quitted the unfortunate monarch and went over to
his rebellious nephew, pleading the interest of his
country in excuse for so treacherous and infamous
an action.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> So great a change had the introduction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
of money already made in the manners of the leading
Spartans!</p>

<p>Plutarch dates the first origin of corruption, that
disease of the body politick, and consequently the
decline of Sparta, from that memorable period, when
the Spartans having subverted the domination of
Athens, glutted themselves (as he terms it) with
gold and silver.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> For when once the love of money
had crept into their city, and avarice and the most
sordid meanness grew up with the possession, as
luxury, effeminacy and dissipation did with the
enjoyment of wealth, Sparta was deprived of many
of her ancient glories and advantages, and sunk
greatly both in power and reputation, until the reign
of Agis and Leonidas.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> But as the original allotments
of land were yet preserved (the number of
which Lycurgus had fixed and decreed to be kept by
a particular law) and were transmitted down from
father to son by hereditary succession, the same constitutional
order and equality still remaining, raised
up the state again, however, from other political
lapses.</p>

<p>Under the reign of those two kings happened the
mortal blow, which subverted the very foundation of
their constitution. Epitadeus, one of the ephori,
upon a quarrel with his son, carried his resentment
so far as to procure a law which permitted every one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
to alienate their hereditary lands, either by gift or
sale, during their lifetime, or by will at their decease.
This law produced a fatal alteration in the landed
property. For as Leonidas, one of their kings, who
had lived a long time at the court of Seleucus, and
married a lady of that country, had introduced the
pomp and luxury of the east at his return to Sparta,
the old institutions of Lycurgus, which had fallen
into disuse, were by his example soon treated with
contempt.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Hence the necessity of the luxurious,
and the extortion of the avaricious, threw the whole
property into so few hands, that out of seven hundred,
the number to which the ancient Spartan families
were then reduced, about one hundred only
were in possession of their respective hereditary
lands allotted by Lycurgus.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> The rest, as Plutarch
observes, lived an idle life in the city, an indigent
abject herd, alike destitute of fortune and employment;
in their wars abroad, indolent dispirited
dastards; at home ever ripe for sedition and insurrections,
and greedily catching at every opportunity
of embroiling affairs in hope of such a change as
might enable them to retrieve their fortunes. Evils,
which the extremes of wealth and indigence are ever
productive of in free countries.</p>

<p>Young Agis, the third of that name, and the
most virtuous and accomplished king that ever sat
upon the throne of Sparta since the reign of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
great Agesilaus, undertook the reform of the state,
and attempted to re-establish the old Lycurgic constitution,
as the only means of extricating his country
out of her distresses, and raising her to her former
dignity and lustre. An enterprise attended not
only with the greatest difficulties, but, as the times
were so corrupt, with the greatest danger.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> He
began with trying the efficacy of example, and
though he had been bread in all the pleasures and
delicacy which affluence could procure, or the fondness
of his mother and grandmother, who were the
wealthiest people in Sparta, could indulge him in,
yet he at once changed his way of life as well as his
dress, and conformed to the strictest discipline of
Lycurgus in every particular. This generous victory
over his passions, the most difficult and most
glorious of all others, had so great an effect amongst
the younger Spartans, that they came into his measures
with more alacrity and zeal than he could possibly
have hoped for.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Encouraged by this success,
Agis brought over some of the principal Spartans,
amongst whom was his uncle Agesilaus, whose influence
he made use of to persuade his mother,
who was sister to Agesilaus, to join his party.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> For
her wealth, and the great number of her friends,
dependants, and debtors, made her extremely powerful,
and gave her great weight in all publick transactions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>His mother, terrified at first at her son&#8217;s rashness,
condemned the whole as the visionary scheme of a
young man, who was attempting a measure not only
prejudicial to the state, but quite impracticable. But
when the reasonings of Agesilaus had convinced her
that it would not only be of the greatest utility to
the publick but might be effected with great ease
and safety, and the king himself entreated her to
contribute her wealth and interest to promote an
enterprise which would redound so much to his glory
and reputation;<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> she and the rest of her female
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
friends at last changed their sentiments. Fired then
with the same glorious emulation, and stimulated to
virtue; as it were by some divine impulse, they not
only voluntarily spurred on Agis, but summoned and
encouraged all their friends, and incited the other
ladies to engage in so generous an enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> For
they were conscious (as Plutarch observes) of the
great ascendency which the Spartan women had
always over their husbands, who gave their wives a
much greater share in the publick administration,
than their wives allowed them in the management of
their domestic affairs. A circumstance which at that
time had drawn almost all the wealth of Sparta into
the hands of the women, and proved a terrible, and
almost unsurmountable obstacle to Agis. For the
ladies had violently opposed a scheme of reformation,
which not only tended to deprive them of those
pleasures and trifling ornaments, which, from their
ignorance of what was truly good and laudable, they
absurdly looked upon as their supreme happiness,
but to rob them of that respect and authority which
they derived from their superior wealth. Such of
them therefore as were unwilling to give up these
advantages, applied to Leonidas, and entreated him,
as he was the more respectable man for his age and
experience, to check his young hotheaded colleague,
and quash whatever attempts he should make to
carry his designs into execution. The older Spartans
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
were no less averse to a reformation of that nature.
For as they were deeply immersed in corruption,
they trembled at the very name of Lycurgus, as much
as runaway slaves, when retaken, do at the sight of
their master.</p>

<p>Leonidas was extremely ready to side with and
assist the rich, but durst not openly oppose Agis for
fear of the people, who were eager for such a revolution.
He attempted therefore to counteract all his
attempts underhand, and insinuated to the magistrates,
that Agis aimed at setting up a tyranny, by
bribing the poor with the fortunes of the rich; and
proposed the partition of lands and the abolition of
debts as the means for purchasing guards for himself
only, not citizens, as he pretended, for Sparta.</p>

<p>Agis, however, pursued his design, and having procured
his friend Lysander to be elected one of the
ephori, immediately laid his scheme before the senate.
The chief heads of his plan were: &#8220;that all debts
should be totally remitted; that the whole land should
be divided into a certain number of lots; and that the
ancient discipline and customs of Lycurgus should
be revived.&#8221; Warm debates were occasioned in the
senate by this proposal, which at last was rejected
by a majority of one only.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Lysander in the meantime
convoked an assembly of the people, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
after he had harangued, Mondroclidas and Agesilaus
beseeched them not to suffer the majesty of Sparta
to be any longer trampled upon for the sake of a few
luxurious overgrown citizens, who imposed upon
them at pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> They reminded them not only of
the responses of ancient oracles, which enjoined
them to beware of avarice, as the pest of Sparta, but
also of those so lately given by the oracle at Pasiphae,
which, as they assured the people, commanded the
Spartans to return to that perfect equality of possessions,
which was settled by the law first instituted
by Lycurgus.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Agis spoke last in this assembly, and
to enforce the whole by example, told them in a very
few words, &#8220;that he offered a most ample contribution
towards the establishment of that polity, of
which he himself was the author. That he now
resigned his whole patrimony into the common stock,
which consisted not only of rich arable and pasture
land, but of six hundred talents besides in coined
money. He added, that his mother, grandmother,
friends and relations, who were the most wealthy of
all the citizens of Sparta, were ready to do the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>The people, struck with the magnanimity and
generosity of Agis, received his offer with the loudest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
applause, and extolled him, as the only king who for
three hundred years past had been worthy of the
throne of Sparta. This provoked Leonidas to fly out
into the most open and violent opposition from the
double motive of avarice and envy. For he was sensible,
that if this scheme took place, he should not
only be compelled to follow their example, but that
the surrender of his estate would then come from him
with so ill a grace, that the honour of the whole
measure would be attributed solely to his colleague.
Lysander, finding Leonidas and his party too powerful
in the senate, determined to prosecute and expel
him for the breach of a very old law, which forbid
any of the royal family to intermarry with foreigners,
or to bring up any children which they might have
by such marriage, and inflicted the penalty of death
upon any one who should leave Sparta to reside in
foreign countries.</p>

<p>After Lysander had taken care that Leonidas
should be informed of the crime laid to his charge,
he with the rest of the ephori, who were of his party,
addressed themselves to the ceremony of observing
a sign from heaven.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> A piece of state craft most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
probably introduced formerly by the ephori to keep
the kings in awe, and perfectly well adapted to the
superstition of the people. Lysander affirming that
they had seen the usual sign, which declared that
Leonidas had sinned against the gods, summoned
him to his trial, and produced evidence sufficient to
convict him. At the same time he spirited up
Cleombrotus, who had married the daughter of
Leonidas, and was of the royal blood, to put in his
claim to the succession. Leonidas, terrified at these
daring measures, fled, and took sanctuary in the
temple of Minerva: he was deposed therefore for
non-appearance, and his crown given to his son-in-law
Cleombrotus.</p>

<p>But as soon as the term of Lysander&#8217;s magistracy
expired, the new ephori, who were elected by the
prevailing interest of the opposite party, immediately
undertook the protection of Leonidas. They summoned
Lysander and his friends to answer for their
decrees for cancelling debts, and dividing the lands,
as contrary to the laws, and treasonable innovations;
for so they termed all attempts to restore the ancient
constitution of Lycurgus. Alarmed at this, Lysander
persuaded the two kings to join in opposing the
ephori; who, as he plainly proved, assumed an
authority which they had not the least right to, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
long as the kings acted together in concert. The
kings, convinced by his reasons, armed a great number
of the youth, released all who were prisoners for
debt, and thus attended went into the forum, where
they deposed the ephori, and procured their own
friends to be elected into that office, of whom Agesilaus
the uncle of Agis was one. By the care and
humanity of Agis, no blood was spilt on this memorable
occasion. He even protected his antagonist
Leonidas against the designs which Agesilaus had
formed upon his life, and sent him under a safe convoy
to Tegea.</p>

<p>After this bold stroke, all opposition sunk before
them, and every thing succeeded to their wishes;
when the single avarice of Agesilaus, that most
baneful pest, as Plutarch terms it, which had subverted
a constitution the most excellent, and the
most worthy of Sparta that had ever yet been established,
overset the whole enterprise. By the character
which Plutarch gives of Agesilaus, he appears
to have been artful and eloquent, but at the same
time effeminate, corrupt in his manners, avaricious,
and so bad a man, that he engaged in this projected
revolution with no other view but that of extricating
himself from an immense load of debt, which he had
most probably contracted to support his luxury.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> As
soon therefore as the two kings, who were both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
young men, agreed to proceed upon the abolition of
debts, and the partition of lands, Agesilaus artfully
persuaded them not to attempt both at once, for fear
of exciting some terrible commotion in the city. He
assured them farther that if the rich should once be
reconciled to the law for cancelling the debts, the law
for dividing the lands would go down with them
quietly and without the least obstruction. The kings
assented to his opinion, and Lysander himself was
brought over to it, deceived by the same specious,
though pernicious reasoning: calling in therefore
all the bills, bonds, and pecuniary obligations, they
piled them up, and burnt them all publickly in the
forum, to the great mortification of the moneyed
men, and the usurers. But Agesilaus in the joy of
his heart could not refrain from joking upon the
occasion, and told them with a sneer, that whatever
they might think of the matter, it was the brightest
and most cheerful flame, and the purest bonfire, he
had ever beheld in his lifetime.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Agesilaus had now
carried his point, and his conduct proves, that the
Spartans had learned the art of turning publick measures
into private jobs, as well as their politer neighbours.
For though the people called loudly for the
partition of lands, and the kings gave orders for it
to be done immediately, Agesilaus contrived to throw
new obstacles in the way, and protracted the time by
various pretences, until Agis was obliged to march
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
with the Spartan auxiliaries to assist their allies the
Ach&aelig;ans. For he was in possession of a most fertile
and extensive landed estate at the very time when he
owed more than he was worth; and as he had got
rid of all his incumbrances at once by the first decree,
and never intended to part with a single foot of his
land, it was by no means his interest to promote the
execution of the second.</p>

<p>The Spartan troops were mostly indigent young
men, who elate with their freedom from the bonds of
usury, and big with the hopes of a share in the lands
at their return, followed Agis with the greatest
vigour and alacrity, and behaved so well in their
march, that they reminded the admiring Greeks of
the excellent discipline and decorum for which the
Spartans were formerly so famous under the most
renowned of their ancient leaders. But whilst Agis
was in the field, affairs at home took a very unhappy
turn in his disfavour. The tyrannical behaviour of
Agesilaus, who fleeced the people with insupportable
exactions, and stuck at no measure, however infamous
or criminal, which would bring in money,
produced another revolution in favour of Leonidas.
For the people, enraged at being tricked out of the
promised partition of the lands, which they imputed
to Agis and Cleombrotus, and detesting the rapaciousness
of Agesilaus, readily joined that party
which conspired to restore Leonidas. Agis finding
affairs in this desperate situation at his return, gave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
up all for lost, and took sanctuary in the temple of
Minerva, as Cleombrotus had done in the temple of
Neptune.</p>

<p>Though Cleombrotus was the chief object of Leonidas&#8217;s
resentment, yet he spared his life at the intercession
of his daughter Chelonis, the wife of Cleombrotus;
but condemned him to perpetual exile. The
generous Chelonis gave a signal instance, upon this
occasion, of that heroick virtue, for which the Spartan
ladies were once so remarkably eminent. When her
father was expelled by the intrigues of Lysander, she
followed him into exile, and refused to share his
crown with Cleombrotus. In this calamitous reverse
of fortune, she was deaf to all entreaties, and rather
chose to partake of the miseries of banishment with
her husband, than all the pleasures and grandeur of
Sparta with her father. Plutarch pays the ladies a
fine compliment, upon this occasion, when he says,
&#8220;that unless Cleombrotus should have been wholly
corrupted by false ambition, he must have deemed
himself more truly happy in a state of banishment
with such a wife, than he could have been upon a
throne without her.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>But though Cleombrotus escaped death, yet nothing
but the blood of Agis could satisfy the vindictive rage
of the ungrateful Leonidas, who, in the former revolution,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
owed his life to that unfortunate prince&#8217;s generosity.
After many ineffectual attempts to entice
Agis from his asylum, three of his intimate friends
in whom he most confided, who used to accompany
and guard him to the baths and back again to the
temple, betrayed him to his enemies. Amphares,
the chief of these, and the contriver of the plot, was
one of the new ephori created after the deposition
of Agesilaus. This wretch had lately borrowed a
quantity of valuable plate, and a number of magnificent
vestments, of Agis&#8217;s mother Agesistrata, and
determined to make them his own by the destruction
of Agis and his family; at their return therefore in
their usual friendly manner from the baths, he first
attacked Agis by virtue of his office, whilst Demochares
and Arcesilaus, the other two, seized and
dragged him to the publick prison. Agis supported
all these indignities with the utmost magnanimity:
and when the ephori questioned him, whether Agesilaus
and Lysander did not constrain him to do what
he had done, and whether he did not repent of the
steps he had taken; he undauntedly took the whole
upon himself, and told them that he gloried in his
scheme, which was the result of his emulation to follow
the example of the great Lycurgus. Stung with
this answer, the ephori condemned him to die by their
own authority, and ordered the officers to carry him
to the place in the prison where the malefactors were
strangled. But when the officers and even the mercenary
soldiers of Leonidas refused to be concerned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
in so infamous and unprecedented an action as laying
hands upon their king, Demochares threatening and
abusing them greatly for their disobedience, seized
Agis with his own hands, and dragged him to the
execution room, where he was ordered to be dispatched
immediately. Agis submitted to his fate
with equal intrepidity and resignation, reproving one
of the executioners who deplored his calamities, and
declaring himself infinitely happier than his murderers.
The unfeeling and treacherous Amphares attended
the execution, and as soon as Agis was dead,
he admitted his mother and grandmother into the
prison, who came to intercede that Agis might be
allowed to make his defence before the people. The
wretch assured the mother, with an insulting sneer,
that her son should suffer no heavier punishment
than he had done already; and immediately ordered
her mother Archidamia, who was extremely old, to
execution. As soon as she was dead, he bid Agesistrata
enter the room, where, at the sight of the dead
bodies, she could not refrain from kissing her son,
and crying out, that his too great lenity and good-nature
had been their ruin. The savage Amphares,
laying hold of those words, told her, that as she approved
of her son&#8217;s actions she should share his fate.
Agesistrata met death with the resolution of an old
Spartan heroine, praying only that this whole affair
might not prove prejudicial to her country.</p>

<p>Thus fell the gallant Agis in the cause of liberty
and publick virtue, by the perfidy of his mercenary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
friends, and the violence of a corrupt and most profligate
faction. I have given a more particular detail
of the catastrophe of this unfortunate prince as transmitted
to us by Plutarch, because it furnishes convincing
proofs, how greatly the introduction of wealth
had corrupted and debased the once upright and
generous spirit of the Spartans.</p>

<p>Archidamas, the brother of Agis, eluded the search
made for him by Leonidas, and escaped the massacre
by flying from Sparta. But Leonidas compelled his
wife Agiatis, who was a young lady of the greatest
beauty in all Greece, and sole heiress to a vast estate,
to marry his own son Cleomenes, though Agiatis
had but just lain-in of a son, and the match was entirely
contrary to her inclinations. This event however
produced a very different effect from what Leonidas
intended, and after his death proved the ruin
of his party, and revenged the murder of Agis.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> For
Cleomenes, who was very young, and extremely fond
of his wife, would shed sympathizing tears whenever
she related the melancholy fate of Agis, and occasionally
desire her to explain his intentions, and the
nature of his scheme, to which he would listen with
the greatest attention. From that time he determined
to follow so glorious an example, but kept the resolution
secret in his own breast until the means and
opportunity should offer. He was sensible that an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
attempt of that nature would be utterly impracticable
whilst his father lived; who, like the rest of the
leading citizens, had wholly given himself up to a
life of ease and luxury. Warned too by the fate of
Agis, he knew how extremely dangerous it was even
once to mention the old frugality and simplicity of
manners, which depended upon the observance of
the discipline and institutions of Lycurgus. But as
soon as ever he succeeded to the crown at the death
of his father, and found himself the sole reigning
king of Sparta without a colleague, he immediately
applied his whole care and study to accomplish that
great change which he had before projected. For
he observed the manners of the Spartans in general
were grown extremely corrupt and dissolute, the rich
sacrificing the publick interest to their own private
avarice and luxury; the poor, from their extreme
indigence, averse to the toils of war, careless and
negligent of education and discipline; whilst the
ephori had engrossed the whole royal power, and
left him in reality nothing but the empty title: circumstances
greatly mortifying to an aspiring young
monarch, who panted eagerly after glory, and impatiently
wished to retrieve the lost reputation of his
countrymen.</p>

<p>He began by sounding his most intimate friend,
one Xenares, at a distance only, inquiring what
sort of a man Agis was, and which way, and by
whose advice, he was drawn into those unfortunate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
measures. Xenares, who attributed all his questions
to the curiosity natural to a young man, very
readily told him the whole story, and explained
ingenuously every particular of the affair as it really
happened. But when he remarked that Cleomenes
often returned to the charge, and every time with
greater eagerness, more and more admiring and
applauding the scheme and character of Agis, he
immediately saw through his design. After reproving
him, therefore, severely for talking and behaving
thus like a madman, Xenares broke off all friendship
and intercourse with him, though he had too much
honour to betray his friend&#8217;s secret. Cleomenes, not
in the least discouraged at this repulse, but concluding
that he should meet with the same reception from
the rest of the wealthy and powerful citizens, determined
to trust none of them, but to take upon himself
the whole care and management of his scheme.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
However, as he was sensible that the execution of
it would be much more feasible, when his country
was involved in war, than in a state of profound
peace, he waited for a proper opportunity; which
the Ach&aelig;ans quickly furnished him with. For
Aratus, the great projector of the famous Ach&aelig;an
league, into which he had already brought many of
the Grecian states, holding Cleomenes extremely
cheap, as a raw unexperienced boy, thought this a
favourable opportunity of trying how the Spartans
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
stood affected towards that union. Without the least
previous notice therefore, he suddenly invaded such
of the Arcadians as were in alliance with Sparta,
and committed great devastations in that part of the
country which lay in the neighbourhood of Achaia.</p>

<p>The ephori, alarmed at this unexpected attack, sent
Cleomenes at the head of the Spartan forces to oppose
the invasion. The young hero behaved well, and
frequently baffled that old experienced commander.
But his countrymen growing weary of the war, and
refusing to concur in the measures he proposed for
carrying it on, he recalled Archidamus the brother
of Agis from banishment, who had a strict hereditary
right to the other moiety of the kingdom;
imagining that when the throne was properly filled
according to law, and the regal power preserved
entire by the union of the two kings, it would restore
the balance of government and weaken the
authority of the ephori. But the faction which had
murdered Agis, justly dreading the resentment of
Archidamus for so atrocious a crime, took care privately
to assassinate him upon his return.</p>

<p>Cleomenes now more than ever intent upon bringing
his great project to bear, bribed the ephori with
large sums to intrust him with the management of
the war.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> His mother Cratesiclea not only supplied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
him with money upon this occasion, but married
one Megistonus, a man of the greatest weight and
authority in the city, purposely to bring him over
to her son&#8217;s interest. Cleomenes taking the field,
totally defeated the army of Aratus, and killed
Lydiadas the Megalopolitan general. This victory,
which was entirely owing to the conduct of Cleomenes,
not only raised the courage of his soldiers,
but gave them so high an opinion of his abilities,
that he seems to have been recalled by his enemies,
jealous most probably of his growing interest with
the army. For Plutarch, who is not very methodical
in his relations, informs us, that after this
affair, Cleomenes convinced his father-in-law, Megistonus,
of the necessity of taking off the ephori,
and reducing the citizens to their ancient equality
according to the institutions of Lycurgus, as the
only means of restoring Sparta to her former sovereignty
over Greece.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> This scheme therefore must
have been privately settled in Sparta. For we are
next told, that Cleomenes again took the field, carrying
with him such of the citizens as he suspected
were most likely to oppose him. He took some
cities from the Ach&aelig;ans that campaign, and made
himself master of some important places, but harrassed
his troops so much with many marches and
countermarches, that most of the Spartans remained
behind in Arcadia at their own request, whilst he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
marched back to Sparta with his mercenary forces
and such of his friends as he could most confide in.
He timed his march so well that he entered Sparta
whilst the ephori were at supper, and despatched
Euryclidas before with three or four of his most
trusty friends and a few soldiers to perform the execution.
For Cleomenes well knew that Agis owed
his ruin to his too cautious timidity, and his too
great lenity and moderation. Whilst Euryclidas
therefore amused the ephori with a pretended message
from Cleomenes, the rest fell upon them sword
in hand, and killed four upon the spot, with above
ten persons more who came to their assistance.
Agesilaus the surviver of them fell, and counterfeiting
himself dead, gained an opportunity of
escaping. Next morning as soon as it was light,
Cleomenes proscribed and banished fourscore of the
most dangerous citizens, and removed all the chairs of
the ephori out of the forum, except one which he
reserved for his own seat of judicature. He then
convoked an assembly of the people, to whom he
apologized for his late actions. He showed them,
in a very artful and elaborate speech, &#8220;the nature
and just extent of the power of the ephori, the fatal
consequences of the authority they had usurped of
governing the state by their own arbitrary will, and
of deposing and putting their kings to death without
allowing them a legal hearing in their own defence.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
He urged the example of Lycurgus himself, who
came armed into the forum when he first proposed
his laws, as a proof that it was impossible to root
out those pests of the commonwealth, which had
been imported from other countries, luxury, the
parent of that vain expense which runs such numbers
in debt, usury, and those more ancient evils,
wealth and poverty, without violence and bloodshed:
that he should have thought himself happy, if like
an able physician he could have radically cured the
diseases of his country without pain: but that
necessity had compelled him to do what he had
already done, in order to procure an equal partition
of the lands, and the abolition of their debts, as
well as to enable him to fill up the number of the
citizens with a select number of the bravest foreigners,
that Sparta might be no longer exposed to
the depredations of her enemies for want of hands
to defend her.&#8221;</p>

<p>To convince the people of the sincerity of his
intentions, he first gave up his whole fortune to the
publick stock; Megistonus, his father-in-law, with
his other friends, and all the rest of the citizens,
followed his example. In the division of the lands,
he generously set apart equal portions for all those
citizens he had banished, and promised to recall them
as soon as the publick tranquillity was restored.
He next revived the ancient method of education,
the gymnastick exercises, publick meals, and all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
other institutions of Lycurgus; and lest the people,
unaccustomed to the denomination of a single king,
should suspect that he aimed at establishing a
tyranny, he associated his brother Euclidas with him
in the kingdom. By training up the youth in the
old military discipline, and arming them in a new
and better manner, he once more recovered the
reputation of the Spartan militia, and raised his
country to so great a height of power, that Greece
in a very short time saw Sparta giving law to all
Peloponnesus.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>The Ach&aelig;ans, humbled by repeated defeats, and
begging peace of Cleomenes upon his own terms,
the generous victor desired only to be appointed
general of their famous league, and offered upon
that condition to restore all the cities and prisoners
he had taken. The Ach&aelig;ans gladly consenting to
such easy terms, Cleomenes released and sent home
all the persons of rank amongst his prisoners, but
was obliged by sickness to defer the day appointed
for the convention, until his return from Sparta.
This unhappy delay was fatal to Greece.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> For
Aratus, who had enjoyed that honour thirty-three
years, could not bear the thought of having it wrested
from him by so young a prince, whose glory he envied
as much as he dreaded his valour. Finding therefore
all other methods ineffectual, he had recourse to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the desperate remedy of calling in the Macedonians
to his assistance, and sacrificed the liberty of his own
country, as well as that of Greece, to his own private
pique and jealousy. Thus the most publick-spirited
assertor of liberty, and the most implacable
enemy to all tyrants in general, brought back those
very people into the heart of Greece, whom he had
driven out formerly purely from his hatred to
tyranny, and sullied a glorious life with a blot never
to be erased, from the detestable motives of envy
and revenge. A melancholy proof, as Plutarch
moralizes upon the occasion, of the weakness of
human nature, which with an assemblage of the
most excellent qualities is unable to exhibit the model
of a virtue completely perfect. A circumstance
which ought to excite our compassion towards those
blemishes which we unavoidably meet with in the
most exalted characters.</p>

<p>Cleomenes supported this unequal war against the
Ach&aelig;ans and the whole power of Macedon with the
greatest vigour, and by his success gave many convincing
proofs of his abilities; but venturing a decisive
battle at Sallasia, he was totally defeated by the
superior number of his enemies, and the treachery
of Damoteles, an officer in whom he greatly confided,
who was bribed to betray him by Antigonus.
Out of six thousand Spartans, two hundred only
escaped, the rest with their king Euclidas were left
dead on the field of battle. Cleomenes retired to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Sparta, and from thence passed over to Ptolemy
Euergetes king of Egypt, with whom he was then in
alliance, to claim the assistance he had formerly
promised. But the death of that monarch, which
followed soon after, deprived him of all hopes of succour
from that quarter. The Spartan manners were
as odious to his successor Ptolemy Philopater, a weak
and dissolute prince, as the Spartan virtue was terrible
to his debauched effeminate courtiers. Whenever
Cleomenes appeared at court, the general
whisper ran, that he came as a lion in the midst of
sheep; a light in which a brave man must necessarily
appear to a herd of such servile dastards. Confined
at last by the jealousy of Ptolemy, who was kept in
a perpetual alarm by the insinuations of his iniquitous
minister Sosybius, he with about twelve more
of his generous Spartan friends broke out of prison
determined upon death or liberty. In their progress
through the streets, they first slew one Ptolemy, a
great favourite of the king, who had been their
secret enemy; and meeting the governor of the city,
who came at the first noise of the tumult, they routed
his guards and attendants, dragged him out of his
chariot, and killed him. After this they ranged uncontrouled
through the whole city of Alexandria, the
inhabitants flying every where before them, and not
a man daring either to assist or oppose them. Such
terror could thirteen brave men only strike into one
of the most populous cities in the universe, where
the citizens were bred up in luxury, and strangers to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the use of arms! Cleomenes, despairing of assistance
from the citizens, whom he had in vain summoned
to assert their liberty, declared such abject cowards
fit only to be governed by women. Scorning therefore
to fall by the hands of the despicable Egyptians,
he with the rest of the Spartans fell desperately by
their own swords, according to the heroism of those
ages.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>The liberty and happiness of Sparta expired with
Cleomenes.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> For the remains of the Spartan history
furnishes us with very little after his death, besides
the calamities and miseries of that unhappy
state, arising from their intestine divisions. Machanidas,
by the aid of one of the factions which at that
time rent that miserable republick, usurped the
throne, and established an absolute tyranny. One
Nabis, a tyrant, compared to whom even Nero himself
may be termed merciful, succeeded at the death
of Machanidas, who fell in battle by the hand of the
great Philop&oelig;men. The &AElig;tolians treacherously
murdered Nabis, and endeavoured to seize the dominion
of Sparta; but they were prevented by Philop&oelig;men,
who partly by force, partly by persuasion,
brought the Spartans into the Ach&aelig;an league, and
afterwards totally abolished the institutions of Lycurgus.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
A most inhuman and most iniquitous action,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
as Plutarch terms it, which must brand the
character of that hero with eternal infamy. As if
he was sensible that as long as the discipline of
Lycurgus subsisted, the minds of the Spartan youth
could never be thoroughly tamed, or effectually broke
to the yoke of foreign government. Wearied out at
last by repeated oppressions, the Spartans applied to
the Romans for redress of all their grievances; and
their complaints produced that war which ended in
the dissolution of the Ach&aelig;an league, and the subjection
of Greece to the Roman domination.</p>

<p>I have entered into a more minute detail of the
Spartan constitution, as settled by Lycurgus, than I
at first proposed; because the maxims of that celebrated
lawgiver are so directly opposite to those
which our modern politicians lay down as the basis of
the strength and power of a nation.</p>

<p>Lycurgus found his country in the most terrible of
all situations, a state of anarchy and confusion. The
rich, insolent and oppressive; the poor groaning under
a load of debt, mutinous from despair, and ready
to cut the throats of their usurious oppressors. To
remedy these evils, did this wise politician encourage
navigation, strike out new branches of commerce,
and make the most of those excellent harbours, and
other natural advantages which the maritime situation
of his country afforded? Did he introduce and
and promote arts and sciences, that by acquiring and diffusing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
new wealth amongst his countrymen, he might
make his nation, in the language of our political
writers, secure, powerful, and happy? just the reverse.
After he had new-modelled the constitution,
and settled the just balance between the powers of
government, he abolished all debts, divided the whole
land amongst his countrymen by equal lots, and put an
end to all dissensions about property by introducing
a perfect equality. He extirpated luxury and a lust
of wealth, which he looked upon as the pests of every
free country, by prohibiting the use of gold and
silver; and barred up the entrance against their return
by interdicting navigation and commerce, and
expelling all arts, but what were immediately necessary
to their subsistence. As he was sensible that
just and virtuous manners are the best support of the
internal peace and happiness of every kingdom, he
established a most excellent plan of education for
training up his countrymen, from their very infancy,
in the strictest observance of their religion and laws,
and the habitual practice of those virtues which can
alone secure the blessings of liberty and perpetuate
their duration. To protect his country from external
invasions, he formed the whole body of the people,
without distinction, into one well armed, well
disciplined national militia, whose leading principle
was the love of their country, and who esteemed death
in its defence, the most exalted height of glory to
which a Spartan was capable of attaining. Nor were
these elevated sentiments confined solely to the men;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
the colder breasts of the women caught fire at the
glorious flame, and glowed even with superior ardour.
For when their troops marched against an enemy,
&#8220;to bring back their shields, or to be brought home
upon them,&#8221; was the last command which the Spartan
mothers gave their sons at parting.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>Such was the method which Lycurgus took to
secure the independency and happiness of his country;
and the event showed, that his institutions
were founded upon maxims of the truest and justest
policy. For I cannot help observing upon the occasion,
that from the time of Lycurgus to the introduction
of wealth by Lysander in the reign of the
first Agis, a space of five hundred years, we meet
with no mutiny amongst the people, upon account
of the severity of his discipline, but on the contrary
the most religious reverence for, and the most willing
and cheerful obedience to the laws he established.
As on the other hand, the wisdom of his
military institutions is evident from this consideration;
that the national militia alone of Sparta, a
small insignificant country as to extent, situated in
a nook only of the Morea, not only gave laws to
Greece, but made the Persian monarchs tremble at
their very name, though absolute masters of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
richest and most extensive empire the world then
knew.</p>

<p>I observe farther, that the introduction of wealth
by Lysander, after the conquest of Athens, brought
back all those vices and dissensions which the prohibition
of the use of money had formerly banished;
and that all historians assign that open violation of
the laws of Lycurgus, as the period from which the
decadence of Sparta is to be properly dated. I observe
too, with Plutarch, that though the manners
of the Spartans were greatly corrupted by the introduction
of wealth, yet that the landed interest (as I
may term it) which subsisted as long as the original
allotments of land remained unalienable, still preserved
their state; notwithstanding the many abuses
which had crept into their constitution. But that as
soon as ever the landed estates became alienable by
law, the moneyed interest prevailed, and at last totally
swallowed up the landed, which the historians
remark as the death's-wound of their constitution.
For the martial virtue of the citizens not only sunk
with the loss of their estates, but their number,
and consequently the strength of the state, diminished
in the same proportion. Aristotle, who wrote
about sixty years after the death of Lysander, in his
examen of the Spartan republick, quite condemns
that law which permitted the alienation of their
lands.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> For he affirms, that the same quantity of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
land which, whilst equally divided, supplied a militia
of fifteen hundred horse, and thirty thousand heavy
armed foot, could not in his time furnish one thousand;
so that the state was utterly ruined for want
of men to defend it.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> In the reign of Agis the
3d, about a hundred years after the time of Aristotle,
the number of the old Spartan families was
dwindled (as I remarked before) to seven hundred;
out of which about one hundred rich overgrown
families had engrossed the whole land of Sparta,
which Lycurgus had formerly divided into thirty-nine
thousand shares, and assigned for the support
of as many families. So true it is, that a landed
interest diffused through a whole people is not only
the real strength, but the surest bulwark of the liberty
and independency, of a free country.</p>

<p>From the tragical fate of the third Agis we learn,
that when abuses introduced by corruption are suffered
by length of time to take root in the constitution,
they will be termed by those whose interest it
is to support them, essential parts of the constitution
itself; and all attempts to remove them will ever be
clamoured against by such men, as attempts to subvert
it: As the example of Cleomenes will teach
us, that the publick virtue of one great man may
not only save his falling country from ruin, but
raise her to her former dignity and lustre, by bringing
her back to those principles on which her constitution
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
was originally founded. Though the violent
remedies made use of by Cleomenes never ought to
be applied, unless the disease is grown too desperate
to admit of a cure by milder methods.</p>

<p>I shall endeavour to show in its proper place, that
the constitution established by Lycurgus, which
seemed to Polybius to be rather of divine than of
human institution, and was so much celebrated by
the most eminent philosophers of antiquity, is much
inferior to the British constitution as settled at the
revolution.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> But I cannot quit this subject without
recommending that excellent institution of Lycurgus
which provided for the education of the children of
the whole community without distinction. An example
which under proper regulations would be
highly worthy of our imitation, since nothing could
give a more effectual check to the reigning vices
and follies of the present age, or contribute so much
to a reformation of manners, as to form the minds
of the rising generation by the principles of religion
and virtue. Where the manners of a people are
good, very few laws will be wanting; but when
their manners are depraved, all the laws in the world
will be insufficient to restrain the excesses of the
human passions. For as Horace justly observes....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />

<small>OF ATHENS.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> republick of Athens, once the seat of learning
and eloquence, the school of arts and sciences, and
the centre of wit, gaiety, and politeness, exhibits a
strong contrast to that of Sparta, as well in her form
of government, as in the genius and manners of her
inhabitants.</p>

<p>The government of Athens, after the abolition of
monarchy, was truly democratick, and so much convulsed
by those civil dissensions, which are the inevitable
consequences of that kind of government,
that of all the Grecian states, the Athenian may be
the most strictly termed the seat of faction. I observe
that the history of this celebrated republick is neither
very clear nor interesting until the time of Solon.
The laws of Draco (the first legislator of the Athenians
who gave his laws in writing) affixed death as
the common punishment of the most capital crimes,
or the most trivial offences; a circumstance which
implies either the most cruel austerity in the temper
of the lawgiver, or such an abandoned profligacy
in the manners of the people, as laid him under a
necessity of applying such violent remedies. As the
historians have not clearly decided which of these
was the case, I shall only remark, that the humanity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
of the people, so natural to the human species, was
interested upon the occasion, and the excessive rigour
of the laws obstructed the very means of their being
carried into execution. A plain proof that a multiplicity
of rigorous penal laws are not only incompatible
with the liberty of a free state, but even
repugnant to human nature. For the natural equity
of mankind can easily distinguish between the nature
and degree of crimes; and the sentiments of humanity
will naturally be excited when the punishment
seems to be too rigorous in proportion to the demerits
of the offender. The chief reason, in my
opinion, why so many offenders in our nation escape
with impunity for want of prosecution, is because
our laws make no distinction, as to the punishment,
between the most trifling robbery on the highway,
and the most atrocious of all crimes, premeditated
murder.</p>

<p>The remedy which Draco proposed by his laws,
proving worse than the disease, the whole body of
the people applied to Solon, as the only person equal
to the difficult task of regulating their government.
The supreme power of the state was at that time
vested in nine magistrates, termed archons or governors,
elected annually by the people out of the
body of the nobility. But the community in general
was split into three factions, each contending for
such a form of government as was most agreeable
to their different interests. The most sensible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
amongst the Athenians, dreading the consequence
of these divisions, were willing, as Plutarch informs
us, to invest Solon with absolute power; but our
disinterested philosopher was a stranger to that kind
of ambition, and preferred the freedom and happiness
of his countrymen to the splendour of a crown.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
He continued the archons in their office as usual,
but limited their authority by instituting a senate of
four hundred persons elected by the people, by way
of ballot, out of the four tribes into which the community
was at that time divided. He revived and
improved the senate and court of Areopagus, the
most sacred and most respectable tribunal, not only
of Greece, but of all which we ever read of in history.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
The integrity and equity of this celebrated
court was so remarkable, that not only the Greeks,
but the Romans, sometimes, submitted such causes
to their determination which they found too intricate
and difficult for their own decision. To prevent all
suspicion of partiality either to plaintiff or defendant,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
this venerable court heard all causes and passed their
definitive sentence in the dark, and the pleaders on
either side were strictly confined to a bare representation
of the plain truth of the fact, without
either aggravation or embellishment. For all the
ornament of fine language, and those powers of rhetorick
which tended to bias the judgment by interesting
the passions of the judges, were absolutely
prohibited. Happy if the pleaders were restricted
to this righteous method in our own courts of judicature,
where great eloquence and great abilities are
too often employed to confound truth and support
injustice!</p>

<p>It is evident from history that Solon at first proposed
the institutions of Lycurgus as the model for
his new establishment. But the difficulty which he
met with in the abolition of all debts, the first part
of his scheme, convinced him of the utter impracticability
of introducing the laconick equality, and
deterred him from all farther attempts of that
nature. The laws of Athens gave the creditor so
absolute a power over his insolvent debtor, that he
could not only oblige the unhappy wretch to do all
his servile drudgery, but could sell him and his children
for slaves in default of payment. The creditors
had made so oppressive an use of their power, that
many of the citizens were actually obliged to sell
their children to make good their payments; and
such numbers had fled their country to avoid the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
effects of their detestable inhumanity, that, as Plutarch
observes, the city was almost unpeopled by the
extortion of the usurers.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Solon, apprehensive of an
insurrection amongst the poorer citizens, who openly
threatened to alter the government, and make an
equal partition of the lands, thought no method so
effectual to obviate this terrible evil, as to cancel all
debts, as Lycurgus had done formerly at Sparta.
But some of his friends, to whom he had privately
communicated his scheme, with an assurance that
he did not propose to meddle with the lands, were
too well versed in the art of jobbing to neglect so
fair an opportunity of making a fortune. For they
stretched their credit to the utmost in loans of large
sums from the moneyed men, which they immediately
laid out in the purchase of landed estates.
A precedent which the treacherous Agesilaus copied
too successfully afterwards at Sparta. The cheat
appeared as soon as the edict for abolishing all debts
was made publick: but the odium of so flagitious a
piece of roguery was thrown wholly upon Solon; as
the censure of the publick for all frauds and exactions
committed by officers in the inferior departments
will naturally fall upon the minister at the helm,
however disinterested and upright.</p>

<p>This edict was equally disagreeable to the rich and
to the poor. For the rich were violently deprived
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
of all that part of their property which consisted in
their loans, and the poor were disappointed of that
share of the lands which they so greedily expected.
How Solon drew himself out of this difficulty, historians
have no where informed us. All we can learn
from them is, that the decree was at last received
and submitted to, and that Solon was still continued
in his office with the same authority as before.</p>

<p>This experiment gave Solon a thorough insight
into the temper of his countrymen, and most probably
induced him to accommodate his subsequent
regulations to the humour and prejudices of the people.
For as he wanted the authority which naturally
arises from royal birth, as well as that which is
founded on the unlimited confidence of the people,
advantages which Lycurgus possessed in so eminent
a degree, he was obliged to consult rather what was
practicable, than what was strictly right; and endeavour,
as far as he was able, to please all parties.
That he acknowledged this, seems evident from his
answer to one who asked him &#8220;whether the laws he
had given the Athenians were the best he could possibly
have made?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> &#8220;They are the best,&#8221; replied
Solon, &#8220;which the Athenians are capable of receiving.&#8221;
Thus whilst he confined the magistracies and the
executive part of the government solely to the rich,
he lodged the supreme power in the hands of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
poorer citizens. For though every freeman whose
fortune did not amount to a particular census or estimate,
was excluded from all state offices by the laws
of Solon; yet he had a legal right of giving his
opinion and suffrage in the &#917;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#945; or assembly of
the people, which was wholly composed of this
inferior class of citizens. But as all elections, and
all cases of appeal from the superior courts were
determined by the voices of this assembly; as no law
could pass without their approbation, and the highest
officers in the republick were subject to their censure,
this assembly became the <i>dernier resort</i> in all
causes, and this mob government, as it may be justly
termed, was the great leading cause of the ruin of
their republick. Anacharsis the Scythian philosopher,
who at that time resided with Solon, justly
ridiculed this excess of power which he had lodged
in the people.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> For when he had heard some points
debated, first in the senate, and afterwards decided in
the assembly of the people, he humourously told
Solon, that at Athens &#8220;wise men debated, but fools
decided.&#8221; Solon was as sensible of this capital defect
as Anacharsis; but he was too well acquainted with
the licentiousness and natural levity of the people,
to divest them of a power, which he knew they would
resume by violence at the first opportunity. The
utmost therefore he could do was to fix his two
senates as the moorings of the constitution.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> That
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
of four hundred, to secure the state against the
fluctuating temper and tumultuous fury of the people;<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
that of the areopagus, to restrain the dangerous
encroachments of the great and wealthy.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> He repealed
all the laws of Draco, those against murder
alone excepted; rightly judging, as Plutarch remarks,
that it was not only most iniquitous, but
most absurd, to inflict the same punishment upon a
man for being idle, or stealing a cabbage or an apple
out of a garden, as for committing murder or sacrilege.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
But as the account handed down to us of the
laws which Solon established is extremely lame and
imperfect, I shall only mention the sarcasm of Anacharsis
upon that occasion, as a proof of their insufficiency
to answer that end for which Solon designed
them. For that philosopher comparing the corrupt
manners of the Athenians with the coercive power
of Solon&#8217;s laws, resembled the latter to cobwebs
which would entangle only the poor and feeble;<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> but
were easily broke through by the rich and powerful.
Solon is said to have replied,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> &#8220;that men would
readily stand to those mutual compacts, which it was
the interest of neither party to violate; and that he
had so rightly adapted his laws to the reason of his
countrymen, as to convince them how much more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
advantageous it was to adhere to what was just, than
to be guilty of injustice.&#8221; The event, as Plutarch
truly observes, proved more correspondent to the
opinion of Anacharsis, than to the hopes of Solon.
For Pisistratus, a near relation of Solon's, having
artfully formed a strong party among the poorer
citizens, by distributing bribes under the specious
pretence of relieving their necessities, procured a
guard of fifty men armed with clubs only for the
safety of his person, by the help of which he seized
the citadel, abolished the democracy, and established
a single tyranny in spite of all the efforts of
Solon.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>This usurpation proved the source of endless faction,
and brought innumerable calamities upon the
republick. Pisistratus was expelled more than once
by the opposite party, and as often brought back in
triumph either by the fraud or force of his prevailing
faction. At his death he left the kingdom to his
two sons Hipparchus and Hippias. The former of
these was assassinated by Harmodius and Aristogiton
for a personal injury they had received;<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Hippias
was soon after driven out of Athens by the
Spartans at the instigation of some of his discontented
countrymen. Despairing of recovering his
former sovereignty by any other means, he fled to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Darius for assistance, and was the cause of the first
invasion of Greece by the Persians, in which he died
fighting against his country in the ever memorable
battle of Marathon. But the most fatal evil which
resulted from the usurpation of Pisistratus, was,
that perpetual fear of seeing the supreme power
again lodged in the hands of a single person.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> For
this fear kept the jealousy of the people in a constant
alarm, and threw them at last into the hands of the
factious demagogues. Hence superior merit was
frequently represented as an unpardonable crime,
and a kind of high treason against the republick.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
And the real patriots were rendered suspected to
the people, just as the demagogues were influenced
by envy or private pique, or even bribed by ambitious
or designing men, who aspired at the very
thing of which the others were unjustly accused.
The history of Athens abounds with instances of the
levity and inconstancy of that unsteady people. For
how frequently do we find their best and ablest citizens
imprisoned or sentenced to banishment by the
ostracism, in honour of whom the same people had
just before erected statues:<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> nay not unfrequently
raising statues to the memory of those illustrious
and innocent men, whom they had illegally doomed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
to death in the wantonness of their power;<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> at once
the monuments of their injustice and too late repentance!
This evil was the natural consequence of
that capital error in Solon&#8217;s polity, when he entrusted
the supreme power to the giddy and fluctuating populace.
A defect which (as I observed before) was
the great leading cause of the loss of that liberty
which they had so licentiously abused. For as the
removal of all the honest citizens either by death or
banishment paved an easy way for usurpation and
tyranny; so it was a measure invariably pursued,
in the democratick governments of Greece, by all
those ambitious men who aimed at subverting the
liberties of their country. This truth is so clearly
explained, and so incontestably proved, by the great
Thucydides, that whilst I peruse the annals of that
admirable historian, I cannot help grieving over the
tragick pages stained with the blood of so many
patriot citizens, who fell a sacrifice to the dire
ambition and avarice of faction. What a striking
detail does he give us of the most calamitous situation
of all the Grecian republicks during the Peloponnesian
war! How does he labour for expression
in his pathetick enumeration of the horrible consequences
of faction, after his description of the
destructive sedition at Corcyra! A contempt of all
religion, the open violation of the most sacred ties
and compacts; devastations, massacres, assassinations,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
and all the savage horrors of civil discord
inflamed even to madness, are the perpetual subjects
of his instructive history. Calamities of which he
himself was at once an eyewitness and a most
faithful recorder.</p>

<p>Thucydides truly ascribes this destructive war to
the mutual jealousy which then subsisted between
the Spartans and Athenians.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65-</a><a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> The most stale frivolous
pretences were trumped up by the Spartans, and
as strongly retorted by the Athenians. Both states
made the interests or grievances of their allies, the
constant pretext for their mutual altercations, whilst
the real cause was that ambitious scheme which
each state had formed of reducing all Greece under
its respective dominion. But an event which both
states seemed to have waited for, quickly blew up
the latent sparks of jealousy into the most violent
flame.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> The Thebans privately entered the city of
Plat&aelig;a in the night (a small state at that time allied
to Athens) which had been betrayed to them by a
treacherous faction, who were enemies to the Athenians.
But the honester part of the Plat&aelig;ans recovering
from their surprise, and taking notice of the
small number of the Thebans, quickly regained possession
of their city by the slaughter of most of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
invaders. The Plat&aelig;ans immediately applied to the
Athenians for assistance; the Thebans to the Spartans.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
Both states entered eagerly into the quarrel
between their respective allies, and engaged as principals
in that destructive war which at last involved
all Greece in the common calamity. Wherever
the fortune of the Spartan prevailed, an oligarchical
aristocracy was established, and the friends to a popular
government destroyed or banished. Where the
Athenians were victors, democracy was settled or
restored, and the people glutted their revenge with
the blood of the nobility. Alternate revolts, truces
violated as soon as made, massacres, proscriptions,
and confiscations, were the perpetual consequences,
in all the petty republicks, of the alternate good or
bad success of those two contending rivals. In a
word, all Greece seems to have been seized with
an epidemick madness; and the polite, the humane
Grecians treated one another, during the whole
course of this unnatural war, with a ferocity unknown
even to the most savage barbarians. The
real cause, assigned by Thucydides, of all these
atrocious evils, was, &#8220;the lust of domination arising
from avarice and ambition:&#8221; for the leading men
in every state, whether of the democratick or aristocratick
party, affected outwardly the greatest
concern for the welfare of the republick, which in
reality was made the prize for which they all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
contended.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> Thus, whilst each endeavoured by every
possible method to get the better of his antagonist,
the most audacious villanies, and the most flagrant
acts of injustice were equally perpetrated by both
sides. Whilst the moderate men amongst the citizens,
who refused to join with either side, were alike
the objects of their resentment or envy, and equally
destroyed without mercy by either faction.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>Historians unanimously agree, that the Athenians
were instigated to this fatal war by the celebrated
Pericles. Thucydides, who was not only cotemporary
with Pericles, but actually bore a command
in that war, does real honour to that great man's
character; for he assigns his desire of humbling
the Spartans, and his zeal for the glory and interest
of his country, as the real motives of his conduct
upon that occasion.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> But, as a detail of this tedious
and ruinous war is wholly foreign to my purpose, I
shall only remark, that if ever union and harmony
are necessary to the preservation of a state, they are
more essentially so when that state is engaged in a
dubious war with a powerful enemy. For not only
the continuation, but the event, of that long war, so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
fatal to the Athenians, must (humanly speaking) be
wholly attributed to the disunion of their counsels,
and the perpetual fluctuation in their measures,
occasioned by the influence of the ambitious and
factious demagogues. Not the calamities of war,
nor the most dreadful plague, ever yet recorded in
history, were able to fix the volatile temper of that
unsteady people.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> Elate beyond measure with any
good success, they were deaf to the most reasonable
overtures of peace from their enemies, and their
views were unbounded. Equally dejected with any
defeat, they thought the enemy just at their doors,
and threw the whole blame upon their commanders,
who were always treated as unpardonably criminal
when unsuccessful. The demagogues, who watched
every turn of temper in that variable people, took
care to adapt every circumstance that offered to
their own ambitious views, either of gaining or supporting
an ascendency in the state, which kept up a
perpetual spirit of faction in that unhappy republick.
Thus, in the beginning of the Peloponnesian war,
Cleon, a noisy seditious demagogue, declaimed violently
against Pericles, and was the constant opposer
of all his measures:<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> but the firmness and superior
abilities of that great man enabled him to baffle all
his antagonists. When Pericles was carried off
by that fatal pestilence which almost depopulated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Athens, the nobility, jealous of that sway which
Cleon had acquired over the people, set up Nicias
in opposition. Nicias was honest, and a real lover
of his country, but a man of no great abilities; and
though an experienced officer, yet cautious and
diffident even to timidity.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> In his temper he was
mild, humane, and averse to bloodshed, and laboured
to put an end to a war which spread such general
destruction: but all his measures were opposed by
the turbulent Cleon; for when the Spartans proposed
an accommodation, Cleon persuaded the Athenians
to insist upon such high terms that the treaty
broke off, and war was again renewed with the same
inveterate fury: but the incendiary Cleon, the chief
obstacle to all pacifick measures, falling in battle in
the tenth year of that war, negociations were again
set on foot, and a peace for fifty years concluded
between the Athenians and the Spartans by the
unwearied endeavours of Nicias.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> But whilst Nicias
was intent upon the enjoyment of that repose
which he had procured, a new and infinitely more
formidable rival started up, and again involved his
country and all Greece in the same calamities by his
restless and insatiable ambition.</p>

<p>Alcibiades now appeared upon the stage; a man
composed of a motley mixture of virtues and vices,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
of good and bad qualities; one who could assume
even the most opposite characters; and with more
ease, than a chameleon can change its colours, appear
a very contrast to himself just as his interest or
ambition required.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> This state Proteus was strongly
piqued at the growing power and reputation of
Nicias. His lust of power was too great to bear
either a superior or an equal;<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> and he determined
at all events to supplant him, alike regardless either
of the equity of the means, or of the consequences
of it to his country. The Athenians were not a little
displeased with the Spartans, who had not been very
punctual in fulfilling the conditions of the treaty.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
Alcibiades finding his countrymen in a humour very
proper for his purpose, inflamed them violently
against Nicias, whom he publickly accused as a secret
friend and wellwisher to that people. Nicias endeavoured
to ward off the blow, and prevent his countrymen
from coming to an open rupture; but the intrigues
of Alcibiades prevailed, who procured himself
to be elected general, and fresh hostilities to be
commenced against the allies of Sparta.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>The seventeenth year of this memorable war is
remarkable for that fatal expedition against Sicily,
which gave a mortal blow to the Athenian grandeur,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
and affords a signal instance of the terrible consequences
of faction. The Egestians, a small state in
Sicily, applied to the Athenians for assistance against
the oppressions of the Syracusans. Alcibiades, looking
upon it as an object worthy of his ambition,
undertook the cause of these suppliants, and knew
so well how to flatter the vanity of his countrymen,
that a large armament was decreed by the people
for that purpose, and Nicias, Alcibiades, and Lamachus,
a daring but able officer, were elected generals.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
Nicias was the only person who had the
honesty or courage to oppose a measure which he
judged not only rash, but to the last degree impolitick;
but the Athenians were deaf to all his remonstrances.
The relief of the Egestians was only
the pretext; for the entire dominion of Sicily, as
Thucydides assures us, was the real object they had
in view when they gave orders for that powerful
armament.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Alcibiades had promised them an easy
conquest of that island, which he looked upon only
as a prelude to much greater enterprises; and the
besotted people had already swallowed up Italy, Carthage,
and Africa in their idle imaginations.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> Both
factions concurred in the vigorous prosecution of this
measure, though from very different motives: the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
friends of Alcibiades, from the view of aggrandizing
their chief by that vast accession of wealth and glory
which they hoped for from this expedition: his
enemies, from the hopes of supplanting him in his
absence, and gaining the lead in the administration.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
Thus the true interest of the state was equally sacrificed
to the selfish and private views of each party!
But, in the midst of these vast preparations, an odd
accident threw the whole city into confusion, and at
once alarmed the superstition and jealousy of the
people. The terms, or statues of Mercury, were
all defaced in one and the same night by some unknown
persons; nor could the Athenians ever discover
the real authors of this reputed sacrilege.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
Proclamations were issued with a free pardon, and
reward for any of the accomplices who could make
a discovery, and the information of strangers and
slaves was allowed as legal evidence; but no information
could be procured as to the true authors of that
particular fact; a circumstance which to me does
not appear at all surprising: for it was evidently, in
my opinion, a piece of party-craft played off against
Alcibiades by the opposite faction, who knew that
to attack the established religion, was to touch the
master-spring of the passions of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
countrymen.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Some slaves indeed, and other low persons
(suborned, as Plutarch asserts, by Androcles,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> one of
the demagogues) deposed, that long before that, some
statues had been mutilated, and the most sacred mysteries
of their religion ridiculed, in a drunken frolick
by some wild young fellows, and that Alcibiades was
of the party.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> This information, which, according to
Plutarch, was a palpable contrivance of his enemies,
enabled them to fix the odium of the last action upon
Alcibiades.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> The demagogues of the opposite faction
greatly exaggerated the whole affair to the
people. They accused him of a treasonable design
against the popular government, and produced his
contemptuous ridicule of the sacred mysteries, and
the mutilation of Mercury&#8217;s statues, in support of
their charge; as they urged his well known libertinism,
and licentious life as a proof that he must
be the author of those insults upon their religion.
Alcibiades not only denied the charge, but insisted
upon being brought immediately to a legal trial;
declaring himself ready to undergo the punishment
inflicted by the laws, if he should be found guilty.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>
He beseeched the people not to receive any informations
against him in his absence, but rather to put
him to death upon the spot if they judged him to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the offender. He urged too, how impolitick it would
be to send him with the command of so great an
army, whilst he lay under the imputation of a crime
of that nature, before they had taken thorough cognizance
of the affair: but his accusers dreading the
effect which his interest with the army, and his well
known influence over the allied troops, which had
engaged in the expedition from their personal attachment
to him, might have upon the people, if he
should be brought to immediate trial, procured other
demagogues of their party to dissuade the people
from a measure which they judged would disconcert
their scheme. These men pleaded the dangerous
delay which such a proceeding might occasion, and
urged the necessity of dispatch in an enterprise of
such vast importance. They proposed therefore that
the fleet should sail immediately, but that Alcibiades
should return when a day was appointed for his trial.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
For their intention was, as Thucydides remarks, to
recall and bring him to his trial when the popular
prejudice ran strong against him, which they knew
they could easily spirit up in his absence. It was
decreed, therefore, that Alcibiades should depart immediately
upon the expedition.</p>

<p>This mighty armament, which carried the flower
of the Athenian forces, was the most splendid, the
best fitted out, and the most expensive, that had ever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
sailed from any of the Grecian ports to that very
time.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> But the first thing we meet with in this expedition,
is (what might naturally be expected) a
disagreement between the three generals as to the
manner of beginning their operations.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> Alcibiades
indeed brought them both over to his opinion; but
whilst he was disputing with his colleagues in Sicily,
his enemies at Athens were by no means idle. The
affair of the statues, and the pollution of the sacred
mysteries, were again brought upon the carpet. The
people, naturally suspicious, never inquired into the
character of the informers, or the validity of the
evidence, but admitted all that offered without distinction;
and, giving easy credit to the most abandoned
wretches, apprehended several of the most
eminent citizens, and committed them to prison.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
One of these persuaded another of his fellow prisoners,
who was most liable to suspicion, to take the
crime upon himself, and to impeach some others as
his accomplices.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> Urging this as a reason, that
whether what he confessed should be true or false, he
would at least secure his own pardon, and calm the
present suspicions of the people. Audocides, for
that was the name of this person according to Plutarch,
though it is omitted by Thucydides, was prevailed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
upon by this kind of reasoning to acknowledge
himself guilty of defacing the statues, and to inform
against some others as accomplices in the same act
of impiety.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> Upon this declaration the informer received
his pardon, and all those who were not mentioned
in his information their liberty:<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> but processes
were made out against as many as he had named,
and all who were apprehended were tried, condemned,
and executed upon his single evidence. Those who
escaped by flight were sentenced to die, and a price
set upon their heads by a publick proclamation.
Whether the persons condemned were guilty or
innocent was not at all clear, according to Thucydides.
Plutarch tells us, that the friends and acquaintance
of Alcibiades, who fell into the hands of
the people, were severely handled on this occasion.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
It is certain therefore that the information was chiefly
levelled at him by the artifice of the opposite faction;
for Thucydides informs us almost in the very next sentence,
that the people received the information against
Alcibiades with all the fury of prejudice, at the instigation
of such of his enemies as had accused him before
he sailed upon the expedition.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> And since they
now had not the least doubt of his being concerned
in the affair of defacing the statues, they were more
than ever convinced that he was equally guilty of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
pollution of the mysteries, and that both those crimes
were committed by him and his associates with the
same design of subverting the popular government.
For a body of Spartan troops happened to make an
incursion, in that very juncture, as far as the Isthmus,
upon some design or other against the B&oelig;otians.
This unlucky incident confirmed the people in their
suspicions that this was a scheme concerted beforehand
with Alcibiades, covered with the specious pretext
of attacking the B&oelig;otians;<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> and that if the plot
had not been happily discovered in time, and the
execution of it prevented by the death of the conspirators,
their city would most inevitably have been
betrayed to the Spartans.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> Thus on every side suspicions
fell strongly upon Alcibiades, and the people
determining to put him to death, sent a private express
to Sicily to recall him and such of his friends
as were named in the information. The officers dispatched
in the Salaminian galley, which was sent on
that occasion, were ordered to acquaint Alcibiades,
that he was desired to return with them to Athens to
clear himself of those things which were objected to
him before the people; but they received a strict charge
not to offer to take him or his friends into custody;
not only from the dread of some mutiny amongst their
own soldiers upon his account, but for fear the allied
troops, whom his influence had engaged, should desert
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
and abandon the enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> Alcibiades obeyed
the summons, and taking his friends, who were included
in the information, into his own ship, left
Sicily in company with the Salaminian galley, seemingly
as if returning to Athens; but, whether he
only suspected, or, which is more probable, had received
intelligence of the measures taken by his
enemies in his absence, he, with his friends, went
ashore at Thuria, and gave the Athenian officers the
slip, not caring to stand the sentence of the credulous
and prejudiced people.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> The officers finding all
their search after him quite fruitless, returned to
Athens without him, and the Athenians passed sentence
of death upon him and all those who accompanied
him, and confiscated their estates for non-appearance.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
Thus, instead of uniting their joint
efforts to promote the success of an enterprise upon
which they had staked their all, the infatuated Athenians
were intent upon nothing but the cabals and
intrigues of faction; and the folly of the people,
managed by their ambitious and selfish demagogues,
deprived the state of the only commander from whom
they could rationally hope for success in that hazardous
expedition. A measure which occasioned the
total ruin both of their fleet and army, and gave a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
fatal shock to their republick; for the soldiers were
not only greatly dispirited at the loss of a chief, in
whose abilities they placed the most entire confidence,
but Alcibiades, in revenge for his usage, took refuge
amongst the Spartans, and prevailed upon them to
send such supplies to the Syracusans as completed
the destruction of the Athenians in that country.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>
Nicias was taken and put to death by the enemy;
not a single ship returned, and few of the men
escaped either slaughter or captivity.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> The news
of this terrible defeat threw the city into the utmost
consternation.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> They at first gave up all hopes,
and imagined they should quickly see the enemy's
fleet in the Pyr&aelig;um whilst they were in this exhausted
and defenceless condition. However, the
dread of the impending danger had this good effect
that it made the populace extremely tractable, and
ready to support their magistrates in whatever measures
they judged most conducive to the common
safety.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> Nor could any thing but union and harmony
amongst themselves have possibly saved them
in the midst of so many enemies, with which they
were surrounded. For all the Greeks in general
were highly elated, as Thucydides tells us, with the
ill success of the Athenians in Sicily.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> Those who
had hitherto observed a strict neutrality in this war
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
wanted no solicitations to join in crushing that unhappy
people, but rather thought it glorious to have
a share in a war which they concluded would be but
of short duration. The Spartan allies were more
than ever desirous of delivering themselves from the
calamities of war which they had so long suffered;
whilst those states, which until that time had received
laws from the Athenians, exerted themselves
above their strength to support the revolt which
they were then meditating. They judged of the
situation of affairs from the blind impulse of passion,
regardless of the dictates of reason, and fancied the
next campaign would finish the ruin of the Athenians.
The Spartans, promising themselves the
certain dominion over all Greece, if the Athenians
were once reduced, made vast preparations for the
war, to which all their allies contributed their
utmost; all got ready for opening the campaign
the spring following.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>The Athenians, now harmony was restored in the
state, recovered their spirits, and begun to act with
vigour.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> They applied themselves to the re-establishment
of their marine, the repairs of their fortifications,
and the care of storing their magazines
with the greatest diligence and economy, retrenching
all such expenses as they judged useless or
superfluous. The good effects of this unanimity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
were visible when the campaign opened, for they
found themselves in a condition to make head against
their numerous enemies, though strengthened by a
new alliance with the Persians, and assisted with
Persian money; and they even gained some considerable
advantages. An event too happened, which
greatly disconcerted the measures of their enemies,
and raised their state once more to its former power
and lustre. Alcibiades, a thorough libertine, who
never stuck at the most infamous means of gratifying
his passions, debauched Tim&aelig;a, the wife of
Agis, king of Sparta, his great friend and protector.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>
Dreading the resentment of that prince for so shameful
a breach of friendship and hospitality, as well as
the jealousy of the Peloponnesians, who had sent
private orders to Astyochus, the Lacedemonian admiral,
to cut him off, he fled to Tissaphernes, at
that time governor of the provinces in the lower Asia
under the Persian monarch.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> Alcibiades, who was
a consummate master in the art of address, quickly
insinuated himself into his good graces, and explained
to him the true interest of the Persians with
respect to the Grecian republicks.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> He showed
him the bad policy of raising one state to a superiority
over all the rest, which would deprive his
master of all his allies, and oblige him to contend
alone with the whole power of Greece. He advised
him to permit every state to enjoy its own separate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
independent government; and demonstrated, that by
keeping them thus divided, his master might set
them together by the ears, and, by playing them one
against another, crush them all at last without the
least danger. He added too, that an alliance with
the Athenians would be more advantageous to the
Persian interest, and preferable to that which he had
made with the Laced&aelig;monians. The crafty Persian
was too able a politician not to relish his advice; he
paid the Peloponnesians their subsidy so ill, and put
off a naval engagement so long, under pretence of
waiting for the Ph&oelig;nician fleet, that he wasted the
strength of their navy, which was far superior to
the Athenian, and ruined all their measures.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>Whilst Alcibiades resided with Tissaphernes, and
gave the Persians the best instructions he could
for regulating their conduct, he at the same time
formed a scheme for procuring the repeal of his
sentence, and liberty to return once more to his
native country.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> He judged the best way to obtain
this favour would be to convince the Athenians of
his intimacy with Tissaphernes. To effect this,
he wrote to the chief officers of the Athenian forces,
which then lay at Samos, directing them to inform
all those of the greatest weight and authority how
desirous he was of revisiting Athens if the government
should be once lodged in the hands of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
small number of the principal citizens; but that he
could by no means think of returning whilst the
democracy subsisted, and the state was governed
by a parcel of abandoned wretches, who had so scandalously
driven him out of his country. Upon that
condition he promised to procure the friendship of
Tissaphernes, and declared himself ready to accept
a share with them in the administration. The event
answered his expectations; for the officers and the
leading men, both of the sea and land forces, which
were at Samos, were eagerly bent upon subverting
the democracy. Thus the treaty was set on foot at
Samos, and the scheme laid for altering the government.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>
The principal men were in hopes of a
share in the administration, and the inferior people
acquiesced from the expectation of large subsidies
from the Persians. Phrynicus, one of the generals,
alone opposed it, sensible that Alcibiades cared as
little for an aristocratick government as for a democracy,
and had no other point in view (which, as
Thucydides acknowledges, was the real truth) than
to procure such a change in the present administration
as might enable his friends to recall him.
The terms, however, which Alcibiades offered, were
agreed to by the rest, and Pisander, one of the leading
men, was sent to Athens to manage the affair.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>Pisander at first met with violent opposition from
the people;<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> and the enemies of Alcibiades in particular
clamoured loudly against the violation of the
laws, when his return was proposed, which they
chiefly dreaded. But Pisander applied so artfully to
the fears of the people, and showed them so plainly
that it was the only resource they had left which
could possibly save the state, that they at last agreed
to it, though with great reluctance.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> He therefore,
with ten others, was appointed to settle the affair
with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades as they should
judge most conducive to the interest of the republick;
but Tissaphernes, who dreaded the power of
the Peloponnesians, was not so ready to enter into a
convention with the Athenians, as they were taught
to believe.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> Alcibiades therefore, to save his credit,
and conceal from the Athenians his inability to make
good what he had promised, insisted, in the name of
Tissaphernes, upon such high terms that the treaty
broke off, and the deputies returned to Samos,
enraged at the trick which they thought had been
put upon them by Alcibiades. Determined however,
at all events, to pursue their scheme, Pisander, with
some of the deputies, returned to Athens, where
their party had already made a considerable progress,
for they had privately assassinated such of the leading
men as were averse to an aristocracy, and though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
they permitted the senate and people to assemble
and vote as usual, yet they would not allow any thing
to be decreed but what they thought proper;<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> besides,
none but those of their own faction durst venture to
harangue the people; for if any one attempted to
speak in opposition, he was sure to be dispatched at
the first convenient opportunity; nor was any inquiry
made after the assassins, or any process issued out
against those who were strongly suspected of the
murders. The people were so terrified with these
bloody executions, that they acquiesced to whatever
was proposed, and every man thought himself happy
if no violence was offered him, even though he continued
quiet and silent. They were deprived even of
the power of bewailing the common calamity to each
other, in order to concert measures for revenge:
for the faction had artfully spread so strong and so
universal a diffidence amongst the popular party,
that no one durst venture to confide in his neighbour,
but each man suspected every other as an
accomplice of the crimes which were daily perpetrated.</p>

<p>In this situation Pisander found the city at his
arrival,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> and immediately prepared to finish what
his friends had so successfully begun: convoking
therefore an assembly of the people, the aristocratick
faction openly declared their resolution to abolish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
the ancient form of government, and to lodge the
supreme power in the hands of four hundred of the
nobility, who should govern the state in the manner
they thought best, with the power of assembling
five thousand of the citizens to consult with as oft as
they thought proper. Pisander was the man who
acquainted the people with this definitive resolution,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
but Antiphon was the person who formed the plan,
and was chief manager of the whole affair: a man,
according to the testimony of Thucydides, who knew
him personally, master of the greatest abilities, and
of by far the most nervous eloquence of any of his
contemporaries. Thus the oligarchy was established,
and the Athenians deprived of that liberty which
they had enjoyed near one hundred years from the
expulsion of Hippias: during which whole space
they had been subject to none, but had been accustomed,
above half that time, to lord it over others;
for as soon as this decree had passed in the assembly
without opposition,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> the chiefs of the conspiracy
artfully permitted such citizens as were upon duty,
but had not been let into the secret, to go wherever
they pleased; but directed their own friends to continue
under arms, and disposed them in such a manner
as might best favour their enterprise: for the
Athenians kept at that time a constant guard upon
their walls, as the Spartan army was encamped in
their neighbourhood. When they had made their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
disposition, the four hundred nobles with poignards
concealed under their habits, and attended by an hundred
and twenty daring young fellows, whom they
employed in their assassinations, surrounded the
senators,<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> and paying them what was due upon their
salaries, commanded them to depart the court.
The senators tamely submitting,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> and not the least
stir happening amongst the citizens, they proceeded
to elect magistrates out of their own body, and performed
all the religious ceremonies usually practised
upon those occasions. When they had thus got
possession of the government, they did not think
proper to recall those whom the people had formerly
banished, for fear of being obliged to include Alcibiades
in the number, whose enterprising genius
they dreaded extremely; but they behaved most
tyrannically to the citizens, putting some to death,
throwing some into prison, and banishing others.</p>

<p>The spirit of liberty however is not so easily extinguished.
Pisander had brought mercenary troops
with him out of some of the cities which he passed
through on his return to Athens, who were of great
service to the new governors in their enterprise:<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> but
the forces at Samos consisted of Athenian citizens,
jealous even of the least attempt upon the liberty of
their country, and declared enemies to every species
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of tyranny. The first news which these brave fellows
received of the usurpation, brought such exaggerated
accounts of the cruelty and insolence of the four
hundred, that they were with great difficulty restrained
from cutting every one to pieces who was
in the interest of the oligarchy. However,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> they
took the command from their former generals, and
cashiered every officer they suspected, substituting
others in their places; the chief of whom were Thrasybulus
and Thrasyllus. Alcibiades was recalled,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
and unanimously declared their captain general both
by the sea and land forces; which gave such a turn
to affairs at Athens, that the four hundred were
deposed, in spite of all their efforts to continue in
power, and the publick tranquillity once more established.</p>

<p>The people confirmed Alcibiades in the command,
and committed the whole management of the war
to his conduct.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> But his soul was too great to receive
his recall from banishment, and even his high
post as an act of favour.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> He determined to merit
both by some signal service, and not to revisit Athens
until he could return with glory. His usual success
attended him in this war, and he seemed to bring
victory with him wherever he appeared; for he
gained so many victories both by sea and land, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
distressed the Peloponnesians so much by his address
and conduct, that he once more retrieved the dominion
of the sea, and returned triumphant to Athens.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>
His entry was splendidly magnificent, adorned with
the trophies of two hundred ships of war, which he
had destroyed or taken, and a vast number of prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>
His reception was attended with all the
honours and applause he had so justly merited.
The people, conscious of the late happy change in
their affairs under the administration of Alcibiades,
lamented with tears their miscarriage in Sicily, and
other subsequent calamities; all which they imputed
to their own fatal error in not trusting the sole command
to so able and successful a commander.</p>

<p>The fortune however of this great man was perpetually
fluctuating, and seemed to be ever on the
extreme; and Plutarch remarks,<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> that if ever man
owed his ruin to his own glory, it must be Alcibiades;
for the people were so prepossessed with the opinion
of his courage and conduct, that they looked upon
him as absolutely invincible. Whenever therefore
he failed in any one point, they imputed it entirely
to his neglect, or want of will; for they could imagine
nothing so difficult, but what they thought him able
to surmount, if he applied to it with earnestness and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
vigour. Thus, in the same campaign, he sailed to
the isle of Andros with a powerful fleet, where he
defeated the joint forces of the inhabitants and Spartans;
but, as he did not take the city, he gave his
enemies a fresh handle for renewing their usual
accusations; for the people already fancied themselves
masters of Chios and the rest of Ionia, and
were extremely out of humour because his conquests
did not keep pace with their heated imaginations.
They made no allowance for the wretched state of
their finances, which frequently obliged him to quit
his army to go in search of money to pay, and provisions
to subsist, his forces, whilst their enemies
had a constant resource for all their wants in the
treasures of Persia. To one of these excursions,
which necessity obliged him to make in order to
raise money, he properly owed his ruin: for leaving
the command of the fleet to one Antiochus, an able
seaman indeed, but rash, in every other respect
unequal to such a charge, he gave him the most
positive orders not to fight the enemy upon any
account whatsoever during his absence; but the vain
Antiochus treated his orders with so much contempt,
that he sailed out with a few ships to brave the Spartan
admiral Lysander, which brought on a general
engagement. The event was, the death of Antiochus,
the defeat of the Athenians, who lost many of their
ships, and a trophy erected by the Spartans in honour
of their victory. Alcibiades, at the first news of this
misfortune, returned to Samos with precipitation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
and endeavoured to bring Lysander to a decisive
action; but the wary Spartan knew too well how
different a man he had now to deal with, and would
by no means hazard a second engagement.</p>

<p>In the mean time one Thrasybulus,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> who bore a
mortal enmity to Alcibiades, posted to Athens, and
impeached him as the cause of the late defeat,
affirming that he committed the care of the fleet to
his potcompanions, whilst he rambled at pleasure
amongst the provinces, raising money, and living in
a state of riot and dissipation with wine and women.
A violent charge, besides, was brought against him
for fortifying a place near Bizanthe,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> as a retreat
upon occasion, which his enemies urged as a proof
that he either was not able, or not willing, to reside
in his native country.</p>

<p>Jealousy and inconstancy were the characteristicks
of the Athenian people. They gave implicit belief
to the suggestions of his enemies, and discharged, as
Plutarch tells us, the fury of their gall upon the
unfortunate Alcibiades, whom they deprived immediately
of the command.</p>

<p>Thucydides,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> speaking of the behaviour of his
countrymen to Alcibiades upon the impeachment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
brought against him for defacing the statues, imputes
their ruin to that jealousy which they constantly
harboured both of his ambition and abilities. For
though he had done the state many great and signal
services, yet his way of life made him so odious to
every individual, that the command was taken from
him and given to others, which not long after drew
on the destruction of the republick.</p>

<p>For Tydeus,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> Menander, and Adimantus, the new
generals, who lay with the Athenian fleet, in the river
&AElig;gos, were so weak as to sail out every morning at
daybreak to defy Lysander, who kept his station at
Lampsacus; and, at their return from this idle
bravado, spent the rest of the day without order or
discipline, or keeping any look-out, from an affected
contempt of the enemy. Alcibiades, who was at that
time in the neighbourhood, and thoroughly sensible
of their danger, came and informed them of the inconveniences
of the place where their fleet then lay,
and the absurdity of suffering their men to go ashore
and ramble about the country. He assured them
too, that Lysander was an experienced and vigilant
enemy, who knew how to make the most of every
advantage: but they, vain of their new power, despised
his advice, and treated him with the utmost
rudeness. Tydeus, in particular, ordered him to be
gone, and told him insolently, that not he, but they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
were now commanders, and knew best what to do.
The event happened as Alcibiades had foreseen. Lysander
attacked them unexpectedly whilst they lay
in their usual disorder, and gained so complete a victory,
that of all their fleet eight vessels alone escaped,
which fled at the first onset. The able Spartan, who
knew as well how to make use of, as to gain, a victory,
soon after compelled Athens itself to surrender
at discretion. As soon as he was master of the city,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a>
he burnt all their shipping, placed a garrison in their
citadel, and demolished the rest of their fortifications.
When he had thus reduced them to a state of absolute
subjection, he abolished their constitution, and
left them to the mercy of thirty governors of his own
choosing, well known in history by the appellation of
the Thirty Tyrants.</p>

<p>This tyranny, though of very short duration, was
to the last degree inhuman. The tyrants sacrificed
all whom they suspected to their fear, and all who
were rich to their avarice. The carnage was so
great, that, according to Xenophon,<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> the thirty put
more Athenians to death in eight months only, than
had fallen in battle, against the whole force of the
Peloponnesians, during ten years of the war. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
the publick virtue of Thrasybulus<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> could not bear to
see his country enslaved by such inhuman monsters:
collecting therefore about seventy determined
citizens, who, like him, had fled to Thebes
for refuge, he first seized upon Phyle,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> a strong fort
near Athens; and, strengthened by the accession of
fresh numbers, which flocked in to him from every
side, he got possession of the Pyr&aelig;um.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> The thirty
tyrants endeavoured to retake it, but were repulsed,
and Critias<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> and Hippomachus, two of their number,
slain in the attempt. The people now, weary of
the tyrants,<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> drove them out of the city, and chose
ten magistrates, one out of each tribe, to supply their
places. The tyrants applied to their friend Lysander,
who sailed and invested the Pyr&aelig;um, and
reduced Thrasybulus, and his party, to an extreme
want of necessaries, for they were yet confined to
the Pyr&aelig;um, as the people, though they had deposed
the tyrants, yet refused to receive them into the
city; but Pausanias,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> one of the kings of Sparta,
who commanded the land forces in this expedition,
jealous of the reputation which that great man had
acquired, gained over two of the ephori, who accompanied
him, and granted peace to the Athenians
notwithstanding all the opposition of Lysander.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Pausanias returned to Sparta with his army, and
the tyrants,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> despairing of assistance, began to hire
foreign troops, and were determined to re-establish
themselves by force in that power of which they
had been so lately deprived. But Thrasybulus, informed
of their design, marched out with all his
forces, and, drawing them to a parley, punished them
with that death their crimes so justly merited. After
the execution of the tyrants, Thrasybulus proclaimed
a general act of indemnity and oblivion, and
by that salutary measure restored peace and liberty
to his country without further bloodshed.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the Peloponnesian war may
properly be termed the period of the Athenian
grandeur; for though, by the assistance of the Persians,
they made some figure after that time, yet it
was of but short duration. The manners of the people
were greatly degenerated, and the extreme scarcity
of virtuous characters, so visible in their subsequent
history, marks at once the progress and the
degree of their degeneracy. Conon, who escaped
with eight ships only when they were so totally
defeated by Lysander, had convinced the Persian
monarch how much his interest was concerned in
supporting the Athenians, and obtained the command
of a powerful armament in their favour.
Whilst the artful Tithraustus,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> general of the Persian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
forces in Asia, raised a strong confederacy
against the Spartans by properly distributing large
sums amongst the leading men of the Grecian
republicks. Conon<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> totally defeated the
Spartan fleet commanded by Pisander, and, by the help of
the Persian money, rebuilt<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> the strong walls and
other fortifications of Athens, which Lysander
had demolished. The Spartans,<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> jealous of the
rising power of the Athenians who seemed to aspire
at recovering their former grandeur, made such
advantageous offers to the Persians by their admiral
Antalcidas, that they once more drew them over to
their party. Conon<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> was recalled and imprisoned
upon the suggestions of Antalcidas, that he had
embezzled the money allotted for the re-establishment
of Athens, and was no friend to the Persian
interest. The Athenians now sent Thrasybulus,
their great deliverer, with a fleet of forty sail
to annoy the Spartans: he reduced several cities
which had revolted to the enemy, but was slain by
the Rhodians in an unsuccessful attempt upon their
island. Conon,<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> according to Justin, was executed at
Susa by the Persians. Xenophon, who lived at
the same time, is silent as to his death; but, whatever
might be his fate, it is certain he is no more
mentioned in history. After the death of these two
great men we meet with none but Chabrias, Iphicrates,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
and Timotheus, the son of Conon, whose
characters are worthy of our notice, until the time
of Demosthenes and Phocion. The martial spirit
of the Athenians subsided in proportion as luxury
and corruption gained ground amongst them. The
love of ease, and a most insatiable fondness for
diversions, now took place of those generous sentiments
which before knew no other object but the
liberty and glory of their country. If we trace the
rise of publick virtue up to its first source, and show
the different effects arising from the prevailing influence
of the different ruling passions, we may justly
account for the fatal and amazing change in that
once glorious republick. A short digression therefore,
on that subject, may perhaps be neither unuseful
nor unentertaining.</p>

<p>Of all human passions, ambition may prove the
most useful, or the most destructive to a people.
The....</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">the fondness for admiration and applause seems coeval
with man, and accompanies us from the cradle
to the grave. Every man pants after distinction,
and even in this world affects a kind of immortality.
When this love of admiration and applause is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
only end proposed by ambition, it then becomes a
primary passion; all the other passions are compelled
to be subservient, and will be wholly employed
on the means conducive to that end. But
whether this passion for fame, this eagerness after
that imaginary life, which exists only in the breath
of other people, be laudable or criminal, useful or
frivolous, must be determined by the means employed,
which will always be directed to whatever
happens to be the reigning object of applause. Upon
this principle, however the means may differ, the
end will be still the same; from the hero down to
the boxer in the bear-garden; from the legislator
who new-models a state, down to the humbler genius
who strikes out the newest cut for a coat-sleeve.
For it was the same principle directing to the same
end, which impelled Erostratus to set fire to the
temple of Diana, and Alexander to set the world in
a flame so quickly after.</p>

<p>There is no mark which so surely indicates the
reigning manners of a people at different periods,
as that quality or turn of mind, which happens to be
the reigning object of publick applause. For as the
reigning object of applause will necessarily constitute
the leading fashion, and as the leading fashion
always takes rise among the great or leading people;
if the object of applause be praiseworthy, the example
of the great will have a due influence upon
the inferior classes; if frivolous or vicious, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
whole body of the people will take the same cast,
and be quickly infected by the contagion. There
cannot, therefore, be a more certain criterion, by
which we may form our judgment of the national virtue
or national degeneracy of any people, in any period
of their existence, than from those characters, which
are the most distinguished in every period of their
respective histories. To analyze these remarkable
characters, to investigate the end proposed by all
their actions, which opens to us all their secret
springs; and to develop the means employed for
the acquisition of that end, is not only the most
entertaining, but, in my opinion, by much the most
useful, part of history. For as the reigning object
of applause arises from the prevailing manners of a
people, it will necessarily be the reigning object of
desire, and continue to influence the manners of
succeeding generations, until it is opposed, and
gradually gives way to some new object. Consequently
the prevailing manners of any people may
be investigated without much difficulty, in my opinion,
if we attend to the increase or decrease of good
or bad characters, as recorded in any period of their
history; because the greater number will generally
endeavour to distinguish themselves by whatever
happens at that time to be the reigning object of
applause. Hence too we may observe the progressive
order, in which the manners of any people
prepared the way for every remarkable mutation in
their government. For no essential mutation can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
ever be effected in any government (unless by the
violence of external force) until the prevailing manners
of the people are ripe for such a change.
Consequently, as like causes will ever produce like
effects; when we observe the same similarity of
manners prevailing amongst our own people, with
that which preceded the last fatal mutation of government
in any other free nation; we may, at such
a time, give a shrewd guess at the approaching
fate of our constitution and country. Thus in the
infancy and rise of the Grecian republicks, when
necessity of self-defence had given a manly and warlike
turn to the temper of the people, and the continuance
of the same necessity had fixed it into a
habit, the love of their country soon became the
reigning object of publick applause. As this reigning
object consequently became the chief object of
desire to every one who was ambitious of publick
applause, it quickly grew to be the fashion. The
whole people in those states glowed with the generous
principle of publick virtue to the highest degree
of enthusiasm. Wealth had then no charms,
and all the bewitching pleasures of luxury were
unknown, or despised. And those brave people
courted and embraced toils, danger, and even death
itself, with the greatest ardour, in pursuit of this
darling object of their universal wishes. Every
man planned, toiled, and bled, not for himself, but
for his country. Hence the produce of those ages
was a race of patriot statesmen and real heroes.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
This generous principle gave rise to those seminaries
of manly bravery and heroick emulation, the
Olympick, Isthmian, and other publick games. To
obtain the victory at those scenes of publick glory
was esteemed the utmost summit of human felicity,
a wreath of wild olive, laurel or parsley (the victor's
prize) that <i>palma nobilis</i>, as Horace terms it, which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>Terrarum dominos evehit ad Deos</i>,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">was infinitely more the object of emulation in those
generous times, than coronets and garters are of
modern ambition. Let me add too, that as the former
were invariably the reward of merit only, they
reflected a very different lustre upon the wearer.
The honours acquired at these games quickly became
the darling themes of the poets, and the
charms of musick were called in to give additional
graces to poetry. Panegyrick swelled with the
most nervous strokes of eloquence, and decked up
with all the flowers of rhetorick, was joined to the
fidelity and dignity of history; whilst the canvass
glowing with mimick life, and the animated marble
contributed all the powers of art to perpetuate the
memory of the victors. These were the noble incentives,
which fired the Grecian youth with the glorious
emulation of treading in the steps of those publick-spirited
heroes, who were the first institutors of these
celebrated games. Hence that refined taste for arts
and sciences arose in Greece, and produced those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
masterpieces of every kind, the inimitable remains
of which not only charm, but raise the justest admiration
of the present times.</p>

<p>This taste raised a new object of applause, and at
last supplanted the parents which gave it birth.
Poetry, eloquence, and musick became equally the
subjects of emulation at the publick games, were
allotted their respective crowns, and opened a new
road to fame and immortality. Fame was the end
proposed and hoped for by all; and those who despaired
of attaining it by the rugged and dangerous
paths of honour, struck into the new and flowery
road,<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> which was quickly crowded with the servile
herd of imitators. Monarchs turned poets,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> and
great men, fiddlers; and money was employed to
bias the judges at the publick games to crown
wretched verses and bungling performers with the
wreaths appropriated only to superior merit. This
taste prevailed more or less in every state of Greece
(Sparta alone excepted) according to the different
turn of genius of each people; but it obtained the
most ready admission at Athens, which quickly became
the chief seat of the muses and graces.</p>

<p>Thus a new object of applause introducing a new
taste, produced that fatal alteration in the manners
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
of the Athenians, which became a concurrent cause
of the ruin of their republick. For though the
manners of the Athenians grew more polite, yet
they grew more corrupt, and publick virtue ceased
gradually to be the object of publick applause and
publick emulation. As dramatick poetry affected
most the taste of the Athenians; the ambition of
excelling in that species of poetry was so violent,
that &AElig;schylus died with grief, because in a publick
contention with Sophocles the prize was adjudged
to his antagonist.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> But though we owe the finest
pieces of that kind now extant to that prevailing
taste, yet it introduced such a rage for theatrical
entertainments as fatally contributed to the ruin of
the republick.</p>

<p>Justin informs us that the publick virtue of Athens
declined immediately after the death of Epaminondas.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
No longer awed by the virtue of that great
man, which had been a perpetual spur to their ambition,
they sunk into a lethargy of effeminate indolence.
The publick revenues appropriated for the
service of the fleet and army were squandered in
publick festivals and publick entertainments. The
stage was the chief object of the publick concern,
and the theatres were crowded whilst the camp was
a desert. Who trod the stage with the greatest
dignity, or who excelled most in the conduct of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
drama; not who was the ablest general, or most experienced
admiral, was the object of the publick
research and publick applause. Military virtue and
the science of war were held cheap, and poets and
players engrossed those honours due only to the
patriot and the hero; whilst the hard-earned pay of
the soldier and the sailor was employed in corrupting
the indolent pleasure-taking citizen. The fatal
consequence of this degeneracy of manners, as Justin
assures, was this: that the able Philip, taking advantage
of the indolence and effeminacy of the Athenians,
who before took the lead in defence of the liberty of
Greece, drew his beggarly kingdom of Macedon out
of its primitive obscurity, and at last reduced all
Greece under the yoke of servitude. Plutarch, in
his inquiry whether the Athenians were more eminent
in the arts of war or in the arts of peace,
severely censures their insatiable fondness for diversions.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a>
He asserts, that the money idly thrown away
upon the representation of the tragedies of Sophocles
and Euripides alone, amounted to a much greater
sum than had been expended in all their wars
against the Persians, in defence of their liberty and
common safety. That judicious philosopher and
historian, to the eternal infamy of the Athenians,
records a severe but sensible reflection of a Lacedemonian
who happened to be present at these diversions.
The generous Spartan, trained up in a state
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
where publick virtue still continued to be the object
of publick applause could not behold the ridiculous
assiduity of the choragi, or magistrates who presided
at the publick shows, and the immense sums which
they lavished in the decorations of a new tragedy,
without indignation. &#8220;He therefore, frankly told
the Athenians, that they were highly criminal in
wasting so much time, and giving that serious attention
to trifles, which ought to be dedicated to the
affairs of the publick.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> That it was still more criminal
to throw away upon such bawbles as the decorations
of a theatre, that money which ought to be
applied to the equipment of their fleet, or the support
of their army. That diversions ought to be treated
merely as diversions, and might serve to relax the
mind at our idle hours,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> or when over a bottle;
if any kind of utility could arise from such trifling
pleasures. But to see the Athenians make the duty
they owed to their country give way to their passion
for the entertainments of the theatre, and to
waste unprofitably that time and money upon such
frivolous diversions, which ought to be appropriated
to the affairs and the necessities of the state, appeared
to him to be the height of infatuation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Could we raise the venerable philosopher from the
grave to take a short survey of the present manners
of our own countrymen, would he not find them an
amazingly exact copy of those of the Athenians, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the times immediately preceding their subjection to
Macedon? Would he not see the same series of
daily and nightly diversions, adapted to the taste of
every class of people, from the publick breakfasting
(that bane to the time and industry of the tradesman)
up to our modern orgies, the midnight-revels of
the masquerade? If he censured the Athenians for
throwing away so much time and attention upon the
chaste and manly scenes of Sophocles and Euripides,
what must he have thought of that strange <i>Shakespearomania</i>
(as I may term it) which prevailed so lately,
and so universally amongst all ranks and all ages?
Had he inquired of those multitudes who so long
crowded both theatres at the representation of Romeo
and Juliet, what were the striking beauties which so
strongly and so repeatedly engaged their attention,
could a tenth part of the affected admirers of that
pathetick poet, have given him a more satisfactory
answer than, &#8220;that it was the fashion?&#8221; would he
not be convinced that fashion was the only motive,
when he saw the same people thronging with the
same eagerness, and swallowing the ribaldry of
modern farce, and the buffoonery of pantomime with
the same fury of applause? must he not have pronounced,
that they as much exceeded the Athenians
in thoughtless levity and folly, as they sunk beneath
them in taste and judgment? For Plutarch does not
find fault with the fine taste of the Athenians for the
noble compositions of those incomparable poets; but
for that excess of passion for the theatre, which, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
setting up a new object of applause, had almost extinguished
that publick virtue, for which they had
been so greatly eminent; and made them more solicitous
about the fate of a new tragedy, or the decision
of the pretensions of two rival players, than about
the fate of their country. But what idea must he
have of the higher class of our people, when he saw
those who should be foremost in a time of distress
and danger, to animate the drooping spirit of their
countrymen by the lustre of their example, attentive
only to the unmanning trills of an opera; a degree of
effeminacy which would have disgraced even the
women of Greece, in times of greatest degeneracy.
If he was informed that this species of diversion was
so little natural to the rougher genius, as well as
climate of Britain, that we were obliged to purchase
and fetch over the worst performers of Italy at the
expense of vast sums; what opinion must he form
of our understanding? but if he was to see the insolence
of these hirelings, and the servile prostration
of their paymasters to these idols of their own
making, how must such egregious folly excite his
contempt and indignation! In the midst of these
scenes of dissipation, this varying round of unceasing
diversions, how must he be astonished at
the complaint of poverty, taxes, the decay of trade,
and the great difficulty of raising the necessary supplies
for the publick service, which would strike his
ear from every quarter! would not his censure upon
our inconsistent conduct be just the same which the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
honest Spartan passed upon the infatuated Athenians?
when a national militia of sixty thousand men only
was asked for, would he not have blushed for those
who opposed a measure (once the support and glory
of every free state in Greece) and whittled it down
to half the number from a pretended principle of
economy? but could his philosophick gravity refrain
a smile, when he saw the same people lavishing
their thousands in subscriptions to balls, concerts,
operas, and a long train of expensive et c&aelig;tera's, yet
so wonderous frugal in pounds, shillings, and pence,
in a measure so essential to the very safety of the
nation? If therefore he saw a people bending under
an accumulating load of debt, almost to bankruptcy,
yet sinking more and more into a luxury, known in
his time only to the effeminate Persians, and which
required the wealth of Persia to support it: involved
in a war, unsuccessful until measures were changed
with ministers; yet indulging in all the pleasures of
pomp and triumph, in the midst of national losses
and national dishonour: ... contracting daily fresh
debts of millions, to carry on that war, yet idly consuming
more wealth in the useless pageantry of
equipage, dress, table, and the almost innumerable
articles of expensive luxury, than would support their
fleets and armies; he could not help pronouncing
such a people mad past the cure of Hellebore, and
self-devoted to destruction.</p>

<p>This strange degeneracy of the Athenian manners,
which Plutarch so severely censures, was first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
introduced (as that great man informs us) by
Pericles.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> That ambitious man determined to supplant
his rival Cimon, who, by the <i>eclat</i> of his victories,
and the services he had done the publick,
was considered as the first man in Athens, and supported
his popularity by the distribution of a large
fortune. Pericles, greatly inferior in point of fortune,
and no way able to contend with him in liberality
and magnificence, struck out a new method of
gaining over the people to his party. He procured
a law, by which every citizen was entitled to a
gratuity out of the publick money, not only for
attending at the courts of judicature, and assemblies
of the states; but even at the entertainments of the
theatre, and the publick games and sacrifices on their
numerous days of festivity. Thus Pericles bought
the people with their own money; a precedent which
has been so successfully followed by corrupt and
ambitious statesmen in all succeeding ages. To this
piece of state-craft, not to superior abilities, late
ministers owed their long reigns, which enabled them
to reduce corruption into system.</p>

<p>The consequence of this corruption, as we may
gather from the writings of Demosthenes, was, that
in a few years time the Athenians were no more the
same people. The annual fund, appropriated to the
publick service for the army and navy, was wholly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
diverted to the support of the theatre. Their officers
regarding nothing but their rank and pay, instead of
patriots, were degenerated into mere mercenaries.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>
The emulation, of who should serve their country
best, no longer subsisted amongst them; but of who
should obtain the most lucrative command. The people
tasting the sweets of corruption, and enervated
by the luxury of a city, which was one perpetual
scene of festivals and diversions, grew averse to the
toils and dangers of war, which now seemed an insupportable
slavery, and beneath the dignity of free
citizens. The defence of the state was committed to
mercenary hirelings, who behaved so ill that their
affairs were in the utmost disorder. Of all their
leading men, Demosthenes and Phocion were alone
proof against the gold of Macedon; the rest were
Philip&#8217;s known and avowed pensioners. Demosthenes,
at this alarming juncture, laid before the people
the ambitious views of Philip, and the distressed
situation of their country, with the utmost freedom.
He employed all the energy and pathos of eloquence,
to rouse them out of that lethargy of indolence and
inattention to the publick safety, into which their own
luxury, and the flatteries of their corrupt demagogues,
had thrown them.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>He demonstrated to them, that the glorious principle,
which had so long preserved the liberty of
Greece, and had enabled them to triumph over the
whole force and opulence of the mighty power of
Persia, was that common hatred, that general detestation
of corruption, which prevailed so universally
amongst their generous forefathers.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> That, in those
times of publick virtue, to receive presents from any
foreign power was deemed a capital crime. That
if any man should be found so shamefully profligate,
as to sell himself to any one, who had designs upon
the liberty of Greece; or should endeavour to introduce
corruption into his own country; death without
mercy would have been his punishment here, and
his memory branded with indelible and eternal infamy
hereafter. That the statesmen and generals of those
happier times, were absolute strangers to that most
criminal and infamous kind of traffick; which was
grown so common and so universal, that honour,
fame, character, the liberty and welfare of their
country were all set to sale, and sold publickly by
auction to the best bidder.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> He then made use of his
utmost art, backed with the greatest strength of reasoning,
to persuade the people, to give up that fund
to the support of the army and navy (the service to
which it had been originally appropriated) which
from the time of Pericles had been applied solely to
defray the expenses of the theatre. He showed next
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the folly and danger of confiding the defence of the
state to mercenary forces, who had already served
them so ill. He informed them, that their allies the
Olynthians earnestly insisted, that the troops sent to
their assistance might no longer be composed of
venal hirelings as before, but of native Athenians,
animated with a zeal for the glory of their country,
and warm in the interest of the common cause.
Both these motions were opposed by the corrupt
party who adhered to Philip. The people were unwilling
to give up that fund, even to the most pressing
exigencies of the state, which enabled them to
gratify their favourite passion; thus the opposition
of the people quashed the former of these motions.
But though the urgent, and repeated remonstrances
of Demosthenes prevailed in favour of the latter, yet
the demagogues, who omitted no opportunity of convincing
Philip, how well he employed his money,
took care to reduce the promised succours to a very
small number, and to procure Chares, a creature of
their own, to be placed at the head of the expedition.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
Small as those succours were, yet they did the Olynthians
essential service. But as all the eloquence
of Demosthenes could not prevail upon his countrymen
to make more vigorous efforts, the city of
Olynthus fell the year following into the hands of
Philip by the treachery of Euthycrates and Lasthenes,
two of the leading citizens.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> Philip still continued
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
his encroachments upon the allies of Athens; sometimes
cajoling, sometimes bullying the Athenians;
just as he found either method most conducive to his
purpose, in which he was punctually seconded by the
corrupt demagogues. But at last the joint attack
which he made upon the cities of Perynthus and
Byzantium, from whose territories the Athenians
drew their chief supplies of corn, at once opened
their eyes, and roused them from their indolence.
They equipped a very large armament with great
expedition; but the Philippick faction had still influence
enough with the people, to obtain the command
of it for their friend Chares. The conduct of this
general was exactly answerable to the opinion and
hopes of his friends, who had procured him that employment.
Chares, voluptuous, yet sordidly avaricious;
vain and assuming, yet without either courage
or capacity; rapacious, and intent only upon enriching
himself at the expense either of friend or foe,
was refused admittance by the inhabitants of Byzantium;
who from experience were too well acquainted
with his character. Enraged at such an unexpected
affront; this doughty general employed his time in
parading along the coasts, detested by his allies whom
he plundered, and despised by his enemies whom he
had not the courage to face. The Athenians, sensible
of their folly, displaced Chares, and gave the command
to Phocion. The able and honest Phocion
was received with open arms by the Byzantines, and
quickly convinced his countrymen, that he was more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
than a match for Philip. He not only drove that
ambitious monarch out of the territories of the allies;
but compelled him to retire with great loss and precipitation
into his own dominions, where Phocion
made several glorious and successful incursions.
Philip now throwing off the masque, marched his
army towards Athens, with a resolution to humble
that people, who were the chief obstacle to his ambitious
views. Demosthenes alone took the lead
upon this occasion, and persuaded his countrymen to
join the Thebans with all the force they could raise,
and make head against the invader. Philip finding
his measures quite disconcerted by this confederacy,
sent an embassy to Athens to propose terms of peace,
and to profess his desire of living in amity with the
Athenians. Phocion, anxious about the success of a
war, which he knew his countrymen had not virtue
enough to support, and where the loss of a single
battle must be fatal to the state, pleaded strongly for
pacifick measures. But the flaming zeal of Demosthenes
prevailed. Phocion was not only insulted, but
excluded from all share in the command of the army
by the infatuated people. Chares, so notorious for
his cowardice and incapacity, who (as Diodorus Siculus
informs us<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>) knew no more the duty of a general
than the meanest private soldier in the army, and
one Lysicles, a man of daring courage, but rash and
ignorant, were appointed commanders in chief. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Demosthenes had pushed on the people to this war,
and was at that time at the head of affairs, this fatal
step must be entirely attributed to his private pique
at Phocion for opposing his measures. Phocion had
more than once beaten Philip with much inferior
forces, and was indisputably the ablest general of
the age, and the only man whom Philip was afraid
of. The conduct therefore of Demosthenes was so
rash and weak in the management of this war,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> that
Plutarch resolves the whole into a certain divine fatality;
which, in the circumvolution of mundane
affairs, had limited the freedom of Greece to that
particular point of time. The battle of Ch&aelig;ronea,
which ensued quickly after, gave the Athenians a
too fatal proof of the superior foresight and sagacity
of Phocion, and their own superlative folly in the
choice of their generals. The battle was fought with
equal bravery and obstinacy on both sides, and the
confederates behaved as well as men could do upon
the occasion; but their defeat was owing entirely to
the incapacity of the Athenian commanders. This
was so apparent,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> that Philip observing a capital blunder
committed by Lysicles in the heat of the action,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
turned about coolly, and remarked to his officers,
&#8220;that the Athenians knew not how to conquer.&#8221;
This fault in point of generalship quickly turned the
scale in favour of the abler Philip, who knew his trade
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
too well to let slip so material an advantage. The
Athenians were totally routed, and that fatal day put
a period to the liberty and independency of Greece.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>Thus fell the Athenians, and their fall involved
the rest of Greece in one common ruin. The decadence
of this once glorious and free state was begun
by Pericles, who first introduced venality amongst
the people for the support of luxury; continued by
the venal orators, who encouraged that corruption
to maintain their influence over the people; but
finished by that fatal disunion between the only two
men, whose publick virtue and abilities could have
saved their country from destruction.</p>

<p>Athens, however, by her fall, has left us some
instructions highly useful for our present conduct.
Warned by her fate we may learn ... that the most
effectual method which a bad minister can take, to
tame the spirit of a brave and free people, and to
melt them down to slavery, is to promote luxury,
and encourage and diffuse a taste for publick diversions
... that luxury, and a prevailing fondness for
publick diversions, are the never-failing forerunners
of universal idleness, effeminacy, and corruption ...
that there cannot be a more certain symptom of
the approaching ruin of a state than when a firm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
adherence to party is fixed upon as the only test of
merit, and all the qualifications requisite to a right
discharge of every employment, are reduced to that
single standard ... that these evils take root, and
spread by almost imperceptible degrees in time of
peace and national affluence; but, if left to their full
and natural effects without controul, they will inevitably
undermine and destroy the most flourishing
and best founded constitution ... that in times of
peace and affluence, luxury, and a fondness for diversions,
will assume the specious names of politeness,
taste, and magnificence. Corruption will put on
different masks. In the corruptors it will be termed
able management, encouraging the friends of the
administration, and cementing a mutual harmony,
and mutual dependence between the three different
estates of the government.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> In the corrupted it will
be denominated loyalty, attachment to the government,
and prudence in providing for one&#8217;s own
family. That in such times these evils will gain
a fresh accession of strength from their very
effects; because corruption will occasion a greater
circulation of the publick money; and the dissipation
of luxury, by promoting trade,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> will gild over
private vices with the plausible appearance of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
publick benefits ... that when a state so circumstanced,
is forced into a war with any formidable
power, then, and not until then, these baleful evils
will show themselves in their true colours, and produce
their proper effects. The counsels in such a
state will be weak and pusillanimous, because the
able and honest citizens, who aim solely at the publick
welfare, will be excluded from all share in the
government from party motives ... their measures
will terminate in poor shifts, and temporary expedients,
calculated only to amuse, or divert the attention
of the people from prying too closely into their
iniquitous conduct. Their fleets and armies will be
either employed in useless parade, or will miscarry
in action from the incapacity of their commanders,
because, as all the chief posts will be filled up with
the creatures of the prevailing faction, such officers
will be more intent upon enriching themselves than
annoying the enemy; and will act as shall be judged
most conducive to the private interest of their party,
not to the publick service of their country. For
they will naturally imagine, that the same power,
which placed them in the command, will have weight
enough to screen them from the resentment of an
injured people ... their supplies for the extraordinary
expenses of the war will be raised with difficulty; ...
because, as so great a part of the publick money
will be absorbed by the number of pensions and
lucrative employments, and diverted to other purposes
of corruption, the funds destined for the publick
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
service will be found greatly deficient. If the
rich are applied to, in such depraved times, to contribute
their superfluous wealth towards the publick
expenses, their answer will be the same which Scopas
the rich Thessalian made to a friend, who asked him
for a piece of furniture, which he judged wholly
useless to the possessor, because it was quite superfluous.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
&#8220;You mistake, my friend; the supreme
happiness of our lives consists in those things which
you call superfluous, not in those things which you
call necessaries.&#8221; The people, accustomed to sell
themselves to the best bidder, will look upon the
wages of corruption as their birthright, and will
necessarily rise in their demands, in proportion as
luxury, like other fashions, descends from the higher
to the lower classes. Heavy and unequal taxes
must consequently be imposed to make up this
deficiency; and the operations of the war must either
be retarded by the slowness in collecting the produce,
or the money must be borrowed at high interest and
excessive premiums, and the publick given up a
prey to the extortion of usurers. If a venal and
luxurious Demades should be at the head of the
ruling party,<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> such an administration would hardly
find credit sufficient to support their measures, as
the moneyed men would be averse to trusting their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
property in such rapacious hands;<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> for the chain of
self-interest, which links such a set of men together,
will reach from the highest quite down to the lowest
officer of the state; because the higher officers, for
the mutual support of the whole, must connive at
the frauds and rapines of the inferior, or screen
them if detected.</p>

<p>If therefore the united voice of a people, exhausted
by the oppressions of a weak and iniquitous administration,
should call a truly disinterested patriot to the
helm, such a man must be exposed to all the malice
of detected villany, backed by the whole weight of
disappointed faction. Plutarch has handed down to
us a striking instance of this truth in the case of
Aristides, which is too remarkable to be omitted.</p>

<p>When Aristides was created qu&aelig;stor, or high
treasurer of Athens, he fairly laid before the Athenians
what immense sums the publick had been
robbed of by their former treasurers,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> but especially
by Themistocles, whom he proved to be more criminal
than any of the others. This warm and
honest remonstrance produced such a powerful coalition
between these publick plunderers, that when
Aristides, at the expiration of his office, (which was
annual and elective) came to give up his accompts
to the people, Themistocles publickly impeached
him of the same crime, and, by the artifice of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
corrupt party, procured him to be condemned and
fined; but the honester, and more respectable part of
the citizens highly resenting such an infamous
method of proceeding, not only acquitted Aristides
honourably, and remitted his fine, but, to show their
approbation of his conduct, elected him treasurer for
the following year. At his entrance upon his office
the second time, he affected to appear sensible of his
former error, and, by winking at the frauds of the
inferior officers, and neglecting to scrutinize into
their accompts, he suffered them to plunder with
impunity. These state-leeches thus gorged with
the publick money, grew so extremely fond of Aristides,
that they employed all their interest to persuade
the people to elect him a third time to that
important office. On the day of election, when the
voices of the Athenians were unanimous in his
favour, this real patriot stood up with honest indignation,
and gave the people this severe, but just reprimand.
&#8220;When,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I discharged my duty
in this office the first time, with that zeal and fidelity
which every honest man owes to his country, I was
vilified, insulted, and condemned. Now I have given
full liberty to all these robbers of the publick here
present to pilfer, and prey upon your finances at
pleasure, I am, it seems, a most upright minister, and
a most worthy citizen. Believe me, O Athenians! I
am more ashamed of the honour, which you have so
unanimously conferred upon me this day, than of
that unjust sentence which you passed upon me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
with so much infamy the year before. But it gives
me the utmost concern, upon your account, when I
see that it is easier to merit your favour and applause
by flattering, and conniving at the rogueries of a
pack of villains, than by a frugal and uncorrupt
administration of the publick revenues.&#8221; He then
disclosed all the frauds and thefts, which had been
committed that year in the treasury, which he had
privately minuted down for that purpose. The consequence
was, that all those, who just before had
been so loud in his praise, were struck dumb with
shame and confusion; but he himself received those
high encomiums, which he had so justly merited,
from every honest citizen. It is evident from this
whole passage, as related by Plutarch, that Aristides
might have made his own fortune, at the expense
of the publick, with the same ease, and to as great a
degree, as any of his predecessors had done before,
or any ministers in modern states have done since.
For the rest of the officers, who seemed to think
their chief duty consisted in making the most of
their places, showed themselves extremely ready to
conceal the speculation of their chief, because it
gave them a right to claim the same indulgence
from him in return. A remark not restricted to the
Athenians alone, but equally applicable to every
corrupt administration under every government.
History, both ancient and modern, will furnish us
with numerous instances of this truth, and posterity
will probably make the same remark, when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
genuine history of some late administrations shall
see the light in a future age.</p>

<p>If the Athenians were so corrupt in the time when
Aristides lived, ought we to wonder at that amazing
height to which that corruption arrived in the time
of Demosthenes, when left to its full effects for so
long a term of years? Could the state of Athens at
that time have been preserved by human means;
the indefatigable zeal of Demosthenes, joined to the
strict economy, the inflexible integrity, and superior
abilities of Phocion, might have raised her once more
to her ancient lustre. But the event showed, that
luxury, corruption and faction, the causes of her
ruin, had taken too deep root in the very vitals of the
republick. The Grecian history indeed affords us
ever memorable instances of republicks bending under
the yoke of foreign or domestick oppression, yet
freed and restored to their former liberty and dignity
by the courage and virtue of some eminent patriot-citizen.
But if we reflect upon the means, by which
these great events were so successfully conducted,
we shall always find, that there yet remained in the
people a fund of publick virtue sufficient to support
their chiefs in those arduous enterprises. The spirit
of liberty in a free people may be cramped and pressed
down by external violence; but can scarce ever
be totally extinguished. Oppression will only increase
its elastick force, and when roused to action
by some daring chief, it will break out, like fired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
gunpowder, with irresistible impetuosity. We have
no occasion to look back to antiquity for convincing
proofs of this most important truth. Our own history
is but one continued scene of alternate struggles
between encroaching princes, aiming at absolute
power, and a brave people resolutely determined to
vindicate their freedom. The genius of liberty has
hitherto rose superior in all those conflicts, and acquired
strength from opposition. May it continue
to prevail to the end of time! The United Provinces
are a striking proof that the spirit of liberty, when
animated and conducted by publick virtue, is invincible.
Whilst under the dominion of the house of
Austria, they were little better than a poor assemblage
of fishing towns and villages. But the virtue
of one great man not only enabled them to throw off
that inhuman yoke, but to make a respectable figure
amongst the first powers in Europe. All the different
states in Europe, founded by our Gothic ancestors,
were originally free. Liberty was as truly
their birthright as it is ours, and though they have
been wormed out of it by fraud, or robbed of it by
violence, yet their inherent right to it still subsists,
though the exercise of that right is superseded, and
restrained by force. Hence no despotick government
can ever subsist without the support of that instrument
of tyranny and oppression, a standing army.
For all illegal power must ever be supported by the
same means by which it was at first acquired. France
was not broke into the yoke of slavery until the in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>famous
administrations of Richelieu and Mazarin.
But though loyalty and zeal for the glory of their
prince seem to form the characteristick of the French
nation, yet the late glorious stand against the arbitrary
impositions of the crown, which will immortalize
the parliament of Paris, proves that they submit
to their chains with reluctance. Luxury is the real
bane of publick virtue, and consequently of liberty,
which gradually sinks in proportion as the manners
of a people are softened and corrupted. Whenever,
therefore, this essential spirit, as I may term it, of a
free nation is totally dissipated, the people become a
mere <i>caput mortuum</i>, a dead inert mass, incapable
of resuscitation, and ready to receive the deepest
impressions of slavery. Thus the publick virtue of
Thrasybulus, Pelopidas, and Epaminondas, Philop&oelig;men,
Aratus, Dion, &amp;c. restored their respective
states to freedom and power, because though liberty
was suppressed, yet the spirit of it still remained,
and acquired new vigour from oppression. Phocion
and Demosthenes failed, because corruption had extinguished
publick virtue, and luxury had changed
the spirit of liberty into licentiousness and servility.</p>

<p>That luxury and corruption, encouraged and propagated
by a most abandoned faction, have made an
alarming progress in our nation, is a truth too evident
to be denied. The effects have been too sensibly
felt during the course of the late and present wars,
which, until the last campaign, were the most expensive,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
and the least successful of any we ever yet
engaged in. But a late signal change must convince
our enemies, that we have a fund of publick virtue
still remaining capable of vindicating our just rights,
and raising us out of that calamitous situation, into
which we were plunged, under some late administrations.
When the publick imagined the helm in the
hands of corruption, pusillanimity and ignorance,
they transferred it to a virtuous citizen, possessed, in
their opinion, of the zeal and eloquence of Demosthenes,
joined to the publick economy, incorrupt
honesty, and immovable fortitude of Aristides and
Phocion. The numerous disinterested marks of approbation,
so lately given from every part of this
kingdom, demonstrate the resolution and ability of
the publick to support that minister, as long as he
pursues his upright plan of conduct with undeviating
firmness.</p>

<p>From the time of Phocion, the Athenian history
affords little more than a detail of scandalous decrees,
and despicable instances of the levity and servile
adulation of that abject people.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> Reduced at last to
a province of the Romans, Athens contributed her
taste for arts and sciences towards polishing, and her
passion for theatrical performances towards corrupting
the manners of that warlike people.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />

<small>OF THEBES.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> accounts of the earlier ages of this ancient
republick are so enveloped in fable, that we must
rather apply for them to the poets than to the historians.
Pausanias gives us a list of sixteen kings
of this country, down from Cadmus inclusive, who
evidently belong to the fabulous times of the heroes.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>
He seems indeed to acknowledge as much,
since he confesses, that as he could find no better
account of their origin, he was obliged to take up
with fable.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> After the death of Xanthus,<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> the last of
those kings, the Thebans, as the same author relates,
disgusted at monarchy, changed the form of their
government into a republick. But it is in vain to
search for the cause, or manner how this revolution was
effected either in Pausanias, or any other historian.
All we can learn of the Thebans or B&oelig;otians from
history,<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> is, that they were remarkable for their dulness
and stupidity, even to a proverb,<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> that, until the
time of Pelopidas and Epaminondas, they made as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
poor a figure in the art of war as in the sciences:
that their form of government was democratick,
and that, as usually happens in that kind of government,
they were divided into factions.</p>

<p>After the famous peace of Antalcidas, by which
the honour and true interest of Greece was sacrificed
to the ambition of the Spartans, whatever state
refused to come into their measures, was condemned
to feel the effects of their resentment. They had
compelled the Thebans to accede to that treaty,
though it deprived them of the dominion over B&oelig;otia;
and afterwards, by the perfidy of the aristocratick
faction, got possession of their citadel, and
reduced them to a state of absolute subjection.
This was the wretched state of the Thebans, until
they were delivered both from foreign and domestick
slavery, and raised to a height of power superior to
every other state of Greece by the virtue of Pelopidas
and Epaminondas. I have selected therefore
this revolution as the most interesting, and most
worthy of our attention; because it exhibits a convincing
proof, that a brave and warlike people are
not the produce of any particular spot,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> but are the
growth of every place and country, where the natives
are trained up in a true sense of shame at mean and
base actions, and inspired with that manly courage
which arises from the emulation after what is just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
and honourable. And that those who are taught to
dread infamy more than the greatest dangers, prove
the most invincible, and the most formidable to an
enemy. It instructs us too, that the most depressed,
and most abject state may be extricated from the
calamities of oppression, and raised to superior dignity
and lustre by a very small number of virtuous
patriots, whilst the spirit of liberty yet remains, and
the people second the efforts of their leaders with
unanimity and vigour.</p>

<p>The Thebans, by a fatal error in politicks, had
chosen Ismenias and Leontidas, who were at that
time heads of two opposite parties, their supreme
annual magistrates. Ismenias was a steady assertor
of the liberty and just rights of the people, and
laboured to preserve a due balance in the powers of
the constitution. Leontidas wanted to engross the
whole power into his own hands, and to govern, by
a small, but select number of his own creatures. It
was impossible for union and harmony to subsist
between two men, who had views so diametrically
opposite. Leontidas therefore, who found his party
the weakest, bargained by a private convention with
Ph&aelig;bidas, the Spartan general, to deliver up his
country to the Laced&aelig;monians upon condition that
the government should be lodged in himself, and
such as he should think proper to intrust. The
agreement was made, and Leontidas conveyed Ph&aelig;bidas
with a strong body of troops into the citadel,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
at a time when the poor Thebans, wholly unapprehensive
of any danger from the Spartans, with whom
they had lately concluded a peace, were celebrating
a publick religious festival. Leontidas, now sole
governor, gave an immediate loose to his passions.
He seized his colleague Ismenias, and, by the assistance
of the Spartans, procured him to be tried, condemned
and executed, for caballing against the state.
A pretence however stale, yet constantly urged by
every iniquitous administration against all who have
the resolution to oppose their measures. The party
of Ismenias, upon the first news of the imprisonment
of their chief, fled the city, and were afterwards
banished by a publick decree. A strong proof of
the fatal lengths a faction will run, which is composed
of those profligate wretches whose sole aim is
their own private emolument! Yet such a faction,
in all free states, when once luxury and corruption
are introduced, is generally the most numerous,
and most prevalent. Athens, not long before, had
been betrayed to the Spartans in the same manner,
and on the same infamous terms by a detestable
faction, composed of the most abandoned of her
citizens, and groaned under the same species of
tyranny until she was freed by the great Thrasybulus.
And, I believe, we have not yet forgot the
strong apprehensions we were lately under, that a certain
free state, upon the continent, was on the point
of being sold to a powerful neighbour by a similar
faction, and by a like iniquitous contract. We must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
remember too, after what manner that scheme was
defeated by the glorious efforts of patriotism and
publick spirit. I shall make no apology for this
digression, because I thought the remark too apposite
to be omitted.</p>

<p>The honest citizens, who had fled Athens, enraged
to see their country thus tricked out of her
liberty, and groaning under the most ignominious
servitude, determined to set her free, or perish in so
glorious an attempt. The scheme was well concerted,
and as boldly executed by Pelopidas, who
entering the city with a small number of the most
resolute of his party in disguise, destroyed Leontidas
and his colleague Archias, with the most dangerous
of his faction; and, by the assistance of Epaminondas
and his friends,<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> with the additional aid of a large
body of Athenians, recovered the citadel. The Spartans,<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>
at the first news of this surprising event, entered
the Theban territories with a powerful army
to take vengeance of the authors of this rebellion, as
they termed it, and to reduce Thebes to its former
subjection. The Athenians, conscious of their own
weakness, and the mighty power of Sparta, which
they were by no means able to cope with, not only
renounced all friendship with the Thebans, but proceeded
with the utmost severity against such of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
citizens as favoured that people. Thus the Thebans,
deserted by their allies, and destitute of friends, appeared
to the rest of Greece as devoted to inevitable
destruction. In this desperate situation of affairs,
the virtue and abilities of these two great men shone
forth with greater lustre. They began by training
their countrymen to the use of arms as well as the
shortness of the time would permit, and inspiring
them with a hatred of servitude, and the generous
resolution of dying in defence of the liberty and
glory of their country. As they judged it imprudent
to hazard a decisive battle against the best troops in
the world, with their new raised militia, they harrassed
the Spartans with daily skirmishes to instruct
their men in military discipline, and the trade of war.
By this method they animated the minds of their
people with the love of glory, and inured their bodies
to the fatigues of war by exercise and labour, whilst
they acquired experience and courage by those frequent
encounters. Thus, as Plutarch remarks,
when these able generals, by never engaging rashly,
but watching every favourable opportunity, had
fleshed the Thebans, like young stag-hounds, upon
their enemies, and rendered them staunch by tasting
the sweets of victory, and bringing them off in safety,
they made them fond of the sport, and eager after
the most arduous enterprises. By this able management
they defeated the Spartans at Platea and Thespia,<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>
where they killed Ph&aelig;bidas who had before so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
treacherously surprised their citadel, and again
routed them at Tenagra, the Spartan general himself
falling by the hand of Pelopidas. Flushed with
this success, the Thebans feared no enemy, however
superior in number; and the battle of Tegyra soon
after raised the reputation of their arms to a degree
unknown before.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> In this action the brave Pelopidas,
with a small body of horse, and no more than three
hundred foot, broke through, and dispersed a body
of Spartans consisting of above three times that
number, made a terrible slaughter of the enemy,
killed both their generals upon the spot, took the
spoils of the dead, raised a trophy on the field of battle,
and brought his little army home in triumph.
Here the astonished Greeks first saw the Spartans
defeated by a much inferior number, and by an enemy
too whom they had always held in the greatest contempt.
They had never, until that time, been beaten
by equal, and rarely by much superior numbers, and,
until that fatal day, were justly reputed invincible.
But this action was only the prelude to that decisive
stroke at Leuctra, which gave a fatal turn to the
Spartan affairs, and stripped them of that dominion
which they had so long exercised over the rest of
Greece. For this series of success, though it greatly
elated the Thebans, yet rather enraged than discouraged
the Spartans. The Athenians, jealous of
the growing power of Thebes, struck up a peace
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
with their ancient rivals, in which all the Grecian
states were included, except the Thebans, who were
given up a sacrifice to the Spartan vengeance.
Cleombrotus, joint king with Agesilaus, entered
B&oelig;otia with the largest, and finest army the Spartans
had ever sent into the field. The great Epaminondas
engaged them at Leuctra with a body of
six thousand Thebans, which scarce equalled a third
part of their enemies, but the admirable disposition
he made, joined to the skill and dexterity of Pelopidas,
and the bravery of their troops supplied the defect of
numbers. Cleombrotus was slain on the spot, his
army totally routed, and the greatest slaughter made
of the native Spartans that had ever happened until
that day, with the loss only of three hundred
Thebans. Diodorus Siculus gives a concise account
of this action in these remarkable words,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> &#8220;that
Epaminondas, being reduced to the necessity of engaging
the whole confederate force of the Laced&aelig;monians,
and their allies, with only a handful of his
city militia, gained so complete a victory over those
hitherto invincible warriors, that he slew their king
Cleombrotus, and cut off the Spartan division, which
was opposed to him, almost to a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>This victory gave so happy a turn to the affairs of
the Thebans, that their alliance was now as much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
courted as before it had been despised and shunned.
The Arcadians applied to them for succours against
the Spartans. Epaminondas and Pelopidas were
sent with a powerful army to their assistance. At
the head of the joint forces these two great men
entered Laconia, and appeared with a hostile army
at the gates of Sparta. The first sight of that kind
ever seen by that haughty people. The masterly
conduct of Agesilaus, and the desperate valour of
the Spartans saved the city, but could not prevent
the ravage of their territories by the two Theban
generals, who restored the Messenians to their kingdom,
of which the Spartans had deprived them near
three hundred years before, defeated the Athenians,
who came to the assistance of the Spartans, and
returned home with glory.</p>

<p>The Theban arms were now so terrible, and their
power grown so formidable, that whilst some states
applied to them for protection, and others for assistance,
the Macedonians referred the disputes about the
succession to that crown to their decision, and gave
hostages as a security that they would abide by their
determination. The chief of these hostages was the
famous Philip, father of Alexander the Great, who
employed his time so well, under those two able
masters, in the art of war, that from them he acquired
that military knowledge which proved afterwards
so fatal to all Greece in general. Thus the publick
virtue of two private citizens not only restored
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Thebes to her former liberty, but raised her to a
much more respectable rank than she had ever held
before amongst the Grecian republicks.</p>

<p>But this eminent, and newly acquired degree of
power was but of short duration. Pelopidas had freed
the Thessalians from the insults of Alexander the
Pherean; but going to him afterwards, accompanied
only by Ismenias, to compose some differences,
he was not only unjustly made prisoner, but
treated with the most spiteful cruelty by that perfidious
tyrant. The Thebans, enraged at this treacherous
act, sent an army against the tyrant, under
the command of two new generals, who returned
with loss and dishonour. The command was again
committed to Epaminondas, who, by the terror of his
name alone, brought the tyrant to reason, and procured
the release of his friend Pelopidas and
Ismenias. But the tyrant soon after renewing his
usual depredations upon the Thessalians, Pelopidas
was once more sent with forces to their assistance.
The two armies came soon to action, when Pelopidas,
blinded by resentment, and eager after revenge,
rushed into the right wing, where the tyrant commanded
in person, and fell, covered with wounds, in
the midst of his surrounding enemies. His death
however was not unrevenged, for his troops, quite
furious at the loss of a general they so much revered
and loved, routed the enemy, and sacrificed three
thousand of them to his <i>manes</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>Though the death of this truly great man was an
irretrievable loss to Thebes, yet Epaminondas still
survived, and whilst he lived, the good fortune and
power of his country remained unaltered. But new
disturbances breaking out not long after, Epaminondas,
at the head of his Thebans, broke again into
Peloponnesus, eluded the vigilance of Agesilaus, and
advanced into the very suburbs of Sparta. But as
they had just before received intelligence of his
approach by a messenger from Agesilaus, they were
so well prepared for his reception, that he judged
proper to retire, and, in his return, fell unexpectedly
upon the Spartans and their allies at Mantinea. The
disposition of his forces upon this occasion is esteemed
a masterpiece of generalship; nor was his
valour inferior to his conduct. He routed and made
a terrible slaughter of the Spartans, but, pushing on
too eagerly to complete his victory, he received a
mortal wound in his breast, and was carried to his
tent. As soon as he recovered his speech, and was
satisfied that his shield was safe, and the Thebans were
victors, he ordered the broken part of the weapon to
be drawn out of his wound, and died rejoicing at the
good fortune of his country. Thus fell the incomparable
Epaminondas, who, as Polybius observes,
overcame his enemies, but was overcome by fortune.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>
The same judicious historian,<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> in his remarks on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
the different constitutions of the ancient republicks,
observes, &#8220;that the flourishing state of the Thebans
was but of short duration, nor was their decay gradual,
because their sudden rise was not founded on
right principles. He affirms that the Thebans took
the opportunity of attacking the Spartans when the
imprudence and haughtiness of that people had made
them quite odious to their allies; and that they had
acquired amongst the Greeks their high reputation
for valour by the virtue and abilities of one or two
great men, who knew how to make the best use of
those unexpected incidents, which so fortunately
offered. He adds, that the sudden change in their
affairs made it quickly appear to all, that their remarkable
success was not owing to the system of
their government, but to the publick virtue of those
who were at the head of the administration. For
that the power and grandeur of the Thebans arose,
flourished, and fell with Epaminondas and Pelopidas
is too evident, he says, to be denied. Whence he
concludes, that the splendid figure the Thebans at
that time made in the world must not be ascribed to
their civil polity, but to those two great men only.&#8221;
I have hitherto considered them only in the light of
virtuous citizens, and able generals; perhaps a short
sketch of their characters as patriot-statesmen may
not be unacceptable nor uninstructing.</p>

<p>Pelopidas and Epaminondas were both descended
from ancient and worthy families. Pelopidas inherited
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
a large fortune, which he enjoyed with
honour to himself and utility to his friends, and by
avoiding the two extremes of avarice and dissipation,
showed that he was the master of, not the slave to
riches. The patrimony of Epaminondas on the contrary
was extremely small, yet equal to his utmost
wants or desires. Devoted wholly to the sciences
and the study of history and philosophy, which mend
the heart, whilst they instruct the head, he preferred
the sweets of retirement and study to a life of pleasure
and ostentation. He avoided all lucrative employments
and state honours, with as much assiduity,
as they were courted and intrigued for by others:
nor did he accept of the highest office in the state,
until he was called to it by the united cry of the
people, and the exigencies of the publick. When
dragged out of his retirement, and placed by force,
as it were, at the head of affairs, he convinced his
countrymen, as Justin informs us, that he was fully
equal to the task, and seemed rather to give lustre
to, than receive any from the dignity of his employment.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>
He excelled in the art of speaking, and was
the most consummate orator of his time; persuasion
hung upon his tongue, and he was the master of the
passions of his auditors by his eloquence, and of his
own by philosophy. With this truly great man
Pelopidas was joined as colleague, who, when he
could not prevail upon his friend Epaminondas to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
share the enjoyment of his own fortune with him,
copied him in the humble virtues of private life.
Thus both became the admiration of their countrymen
for their temperance and moderation, as well as
their plainness in dress; and frugality at their table.
But the most striking part of their character, was
that unexampled union and perfect harmony which
subsisted between these two great men, and ended
only with their lives. They filled at one and the
same time the two highest posts in the state. The
whole management of publick affairs was intrusted
to their conduct, and all business passed through
their hands. Yet during all that time, no latent
spark of envy, jealousy or ambition, no private or
selfish views or difference of sentiments (the fatal,
but too general sources of disunion amongst statesmen)
could in the least affect their friendship, or
ever make any impression upon an union, which was
founded upon the immovable basis of publick virtue.
Animated, as Plutarch observes, and directing all
their actions by this principle only, they had no
other in view but that of the publick; and instead of
enriching or aggrandizing their own families, the
only emulation between them was, which should
contribute most to the advancement of the dignity
and happiness of his country. To crown all, they
both died gloriously in defence of that independency,
which they had acquired and preserved to the state,
and left the Thebans free, great, and flourishing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>It is natural to think, that men of such superior
merit, and so eminently disinterested, could never
possibly be the objects of party resentment. Yet
we are assured in history, that they were frequently
persecuted by a virulent faction composed of the
selfish, those leeches whom these two virtuous men
prevented from fattening upon the blood of the publick,
and of the envious, from that strong antipathy
which bad men naturally bear to the good.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> For
envy, that passion of low uncultivated minds, has a
greater share in party opposition than we are apt to
imagine. A truth of which we have strong proof
in that celebrated passage, recorded by Plutarch,<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>
between Aristides and the Athenian countrymen.
Though the virtue of these great men triumphed
over all the malicious efforts of these domestick
enemies; yet they had power enough at one time to
impeach and bring them both to a publick trial for a
breach of formality relative to their office, though
that very act had enabled them to render the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
signal services to their country.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> They were tried
however, but honourably acquitted. At another
time, whilst Pelopidas was detained prisoner by
Alexander the Pherean, this malignant faction had
weight enough to exclude Epaminondas from the
office of polemarque or general, and to procure for
two of their friends, the command of that army
which was sent to punish the tyrant for his treachery.
But the new generals made such wretched work of
it, when they came to face the enemy, that the
whole army was quickly thrown into the utmost confusion,
and compelled for their own preservation, to
put Epaminondas at their head, who was present at
the action only as a volunteer: for the malice of his
enemies had excluded him from the least shadow of
trust or power. This able man, by a <i>man&oelig;uvre</i>
peculiar to himself, extricated the Theban troops
out of those difficulties in which the ignorance and
incapacity of their generals had involved them, repulsed
the enemy, and by a fine retreat brought the
army safe to Thebes. His countrymen, now sensible
of their error, and how greatly they had been imposed
upon by the faction, immediately recalled him to the
highest offices in the state, which he continued to
execute until his death, with the greatest honour to
himself, and emolument, as well as glory, to his
country. As the management of publick affairs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
after the death of these two illustrious patriots fell by
the intrigues of faction, into the hands of men of a
quite different character, we need not wonder that
the Thebans sunk alike in power and reputation until
Thebes itself was totally destroyed by Alexander the
Great, and their country, with the rest of Greece,
swallowed up at last by the insatiable ambition of
the Romans.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />

<small>OF CARTHAGE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the free states whose memory is preserved
to us in history, Carthage bears the nearest resemblance
to Britain, both in her commerce, opulence,
sovereignty of the sea, and her method of carrying on
her land wars by foreign mercenaries. If to these we
add the vicinity of the Carthaginians to the Romans,
the most formidable and most rapacious people at
that time in Europe, and the specifick difference, as
I may term it, of the respective military force of
each nation, the situation of Carthage with respect
to Rome, seems greatly analogous to that of Britain
with respect to France, at least for this last century.
Consequently, the dreadful fate of that republick,
once the most flourishing state in the universe, and
the most formidable rival Rome ever had to cope
with, must merit our highest attention at this juncture:
both as the greatness of her power arose
from, and was supported by commerce, and as she
owed her ruin more to her own intestine divisions,
than to the arms of the Romans.</p>

<p>We know very little of this opulent and powerful
people until the time of the first Punick war. For
as not one of their own historians has reached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
our times, we have no accounts of them but what
are transmitted to us by their enemies. Such writers
consequently deserve little credit, as well from
their ignorance of the Carthaginian constitution, as
their inveterate prejudice against that great people.
Hence it is that we know so little of their laws, and
have but an imperfect idea of their constitutional
form of government.</p>

<p>The government of Carthage, if we may credit the
judicious Aristotle, seems to have been founded on
the wisest maxim of policy. For he affirms, the
different branches of their legislature were so exactly
balanced,<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> that for the space of five hundred years,
from the commencement of the republick down to
his time, the repose of Carthage had never been
disturbed by any considerable sedition, or her liberty
invaded by any single tyrant: the two fatal evils to
which every republican government is daily liable,
from the very nature of their constitution. An
additional proof too may be drawn from this consideration,
that Carthage was able to support herself
upwards of seven hundred years in opulence and
splendour in the midst of so many powerful enemies,
and during the greater part of that time, was the
centre of commerce of the known world, and enjoyed
the uninterrupted sovereignty of the sea without a
rival.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>The genius of the Carthaginians was warlike as
well as commercial, and affords undeniable proof,
that those qualities are by no means incompatible to
the same people. It is almost impossible indeed to
discover the real character of this great people. The
Roman historians, their implacable enemies, constantly
paint them in the blackest colours, to palliate
the perfidious and merciless behaviour of their own
countrymen towards that unfortunate republick. A
fact so notorious, that neither Livy, nor any other of
their writers, with all their art, were able to conceal
it. The Greek historians, whose countrymen had
suffered so greatly by the Carthaginian arms in
Sicily and all the other islands in the Mediterranean,
betray as strong a prejudice against them as the
Roman. Even the respectable Polybius, the only
author amongst them who deserves any degree of
credit, is plainly partial, when he speaks of the
Carthaginian manners. The Romans continually
charge them with the want of publick faith, and
have handed down the <i>Punica fides</i> as a proverb. I
shall take notice of this scandalous charge in another
place, where I shall show how much more justly it
may be retorted upon the Romans.</p>

<p>As the desire of gain is the chief spur to commerce,
and as the greatest men in Carthage never
thought it beneath them to engage in that lucrative
employment, all the historians have represented the
whole body of the people as so insatiably fond of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
amassing wealth, that they esteemed even the lowest
and dirtiest means lawful, that tended to the acquisition
of their darling object. &#8220;Amongst the Carthaginians,&#8221;
says Polybius, when he compares the
manners of that people with those of the Romans,
&#8220;nothing was infamous that was attended with
gain.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> Amongst the Romans nothing so infamous
as bribery,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> and to enrich themselves by unwarrantable
means.&#8221; He adds in proof of his assertion,
that, &#8220;at Carthage all the dignities, and highest
employments in the state were openly sold.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> A practice,
he affirms, which at Rome was a capital crime.&#8221;
Yet but a few pages before, where he inveighs bitterly
against the sordid love of money, and rapacious
avarice of the Cretans, he remarks that, &#8220;they
were the only people in the world to whom no kind
of gain appeared either infamous or unlawful.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> In
another place where he censures the Greeks for
aspersing Titus Flamius the Roman general, as if
he had not been proof against the gold of Macedon,
he affirms, &#8220;that whilst the Romans preserved the
virtuous manners of their forefathers, and had not
yet carried their arms into foreign countries, not a
single man of them would have been guilty of a
crime of that nature.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> But though he can boldly
assert, as he says, &#8220;that in his time many of the
Romans, if taken man by man, were able to preserve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
he trust reposed in them inviolable as to that point,
yet he owns he durst not venture to say the same of
all.&#8221; Though he speaks as modestly as he can to
avoid giving offence, yet this hint is sufficient to
convince us, that corruption was neither new nor
uncommon at that time amongst the Romans. But
as I shall resume this subject in a more proper
place, I shall only observe from Polybius&#8217;s own
detail of the history of the Carthaginians, that unless
when the intrigues of faction prevailed, all their
great posts were generally filled by men of the most
distinguished merit.</p>

<p>The charge of cruelty is brought against them
with a very ill grace by the Romans, who treated
even monarchs themselves, if they were so unhappy
as to become their prisoners of war, with the utmost
inhumanity, and threw them to perish in dungeons,
after they had exposed them in triumph to the
insults of their own populace.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p>The story indeed of Regulus has afforded a noble
subject for Horace, which he has embellished with
some of the most beautiful strokes of poetry, and
that fine ode has propagated and confirmed the
belief of it, more perhaps than the writings of all
their historians. But as neither Polybius nor Diodorus
Siculus makes the least mention of such an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
event (though the Greeks bore an equal aversion to
the Carthaginians) and as the Roman writers from
whom we received it, differ greatly in their accounts
of it, I cannot help joining in opinion with many
learned men, that it was a Roman forgery.</p>

<p>The Greek writers accuse them of barbarism and
a total ignorance of the <i>belles lettres</i>, the study of
which was the reigning taste of Greece. Rollin
contemptuously affirms, that their education in general
amounted to no more than writing and the
knowledge of merchants accounts; that a Carthaginian
philosopher would have been a prodigy
amongst the learned; and then asks, &#8220;what would
they have thought of a geometrician or astronomer
of that nation?&#8221; Rollin seems to have put this
question too hastily, since it is unanimously confessed;
that they were the best ship builders, the
ablest navigators, and the most skilful mechanicks
at that time in the world: that they raised abundance
of magnificent structures, and very well
understood the art of fortification; all which (especially
as the use of the compass was then unknown)
must of necessity imply a more than common knowledge
of astronomy, geometry, and every other
branch of mathematicks. Let me add too that their
knowledge in agriculture was so eminent;<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> that the
works of Mago the Carthaginian upon that subject
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
were ordered to be translated by a decree of the
senate for the use of the Romans and their colonies.</p>

<p>That the education of their youth was not confined
to the mercantile part only, must be evident from
that number of great men, who make such a figure
in their history; particularly Hannibal, perhaps the
greatest captain which any age has ever yet produced,
and at the same time the most consummate
statesman, and disinterested patriot. Painting, sculpture,
and poetry, they seem to have left to their
more idle and more luxurious neighbours the Greeks,
and applied their wealth to the infinitely nobler uses
of supporting their marine, enlarging and protecting
their commerce and colonies. What opinion even
the wiser part of the Romans had of these specious
arts, and how unworthy they judged them of the
close attention of a brave and free people, we may
learn from the advice which Virgil gives his countrymen
by the mouth of his hero&#8217;s father Anchises.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>
I have endeavoured here to clear the much injured
character of this great people from the aspersions
and gross misrepresentations of historians, by proofs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
drawn from the concessions and self-contradictions
of the historians themselves.</p>

<p>The state of Carthage bears so near a resemblance
to that of our own nation, both in their constitution
(as far as we are able to judge of it) maritime power,
commerce, party divisions, and long as well as
bloody war which they carried on with the most
powerful nation in the universe, that their history,
I again repeat it, affords us, in my judgment, more
useful rules for our present conduct than that of any
other ancient republick. As we are engaged in a
war (which was until very lately unsuccessful) with
an enemy, less powerful indeed, but equally rapacious
as the Romans, and acting upon the same
principles, we ought most carefully to beware of
those false steps both in war and policy, which
brought on the ruin of the Carthaginians. For
should we be so unhappy as to be compelled to
receive law from that haughty nation, we must
expect to be reduced to the same wretched situation
in which the Romans left Carthage at the conclusion
of the second Punick war. This island has been
hitherto the inexpugnable barrier of the liberties of
Europe, and is as much the object of the jealousy
and hatred of the French as ever Carthage was of
the Romans. As they are sensible that nothing
but the destruction of this country can open them a
way to their grand project of universal monarchy,
we may be certain that <i>delenda est Britannia</i> will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
as much the popular maxim at Paris, as <i>delenda est
Carthago</i> was at Rome.... But I shall wave these
reflections at present, and point out the real causes
of the total ruin of that powerful republick.</p>

<p>Carthage took its rise from a handful of distressed
Tyrians who settled in that country by permission
of the natives, like our colonies in America, and
actually paid a kind of rent, under the name of
tribute, for the very ground on which their city was
founded. As they brought with them the commercial
genius of their mother country they soon arrived
at such a state of opulence by their frugality and
indefatigable industry, as occasioned the envy of their
poorer neighbours. Thus jealousy on the one hand,
and pride naturally arising from great wealth on the
other, quickly involved them in a war. The natives
justly feared the growing power of the Carthaginians,
and the latter feeling their own strength, wanted to
throw off the yoke of tribute, which they looked
upon as dishonourable and even galling to a free
people. The contest was by no means equal. The
neighbouring princes were poor and divided by
separate interests, the Carthaginians were rich and
united in one common cause. Their commerce made
them masters of the sea, and their wealth enabled
them to bribe one part of their neighbours to fight
against the other, and thus by playing one against
the other alternately, they reduced all at last to be
their tributaries, and extended their dominions near
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
two thousand miles upon that continent. It may be
objected that the conduct of the Carthaginians in this
case was highly criminal. I grant it: but if we view
all those master strokes of policy, and all those
splendid conquests which shine so much in history,
in their true colours, they will appear to be
nothing more than fraud and robbery, gilded over
with those pompous appellations. Did not every
nation that makes a figure in history rise to empire
upon the ruin of their neighbours? did not France
acquire her present formidable power, and is she not
at this time endeavouring to worm us out of our
American settlements by the very same means? but
though the motives are not to be justified, yet the
conduct of the Carthaginians upon these occasions,
will afford us some very useful and instructive lessons
in our present situation.</p>

<p>It is evident that the mighty power of these people
was founded in and supported by commerce, and
that they owed their vast acquisitions, which extended
down both sides of the Mediterranean quite into the
main ocean, to a right application of the publick
money, and a proper exertion of their naval force.
Had they bounded their views to this single point,
viz. the support of their commerce and colonies,
they either would not have given such terrible umbrage
to the Romans, who, as Polybius observes,
could brook no equal, or might safely have bid
defiance to their utmost efforts. For the immense
sums which they squandered away in subsidies to so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
many foreign princes, and to support such numerous
armies of foreign mercenaries, which they constantly
kept in pay, to complete the reduction of
Spain and Sicily, would have enabled them to cover
their coasts with such a fleet as would have secured
them from any apprehension of foreign invasions.
Besides ... the Roman genius was so little turned for
maritime affairs, that at the time of their first breach
with Carthage they were not masters of one single
ship of war, and were such absolute strangers to the
mechanism of a ship, that a Carthaginian galley
driven by accident on their coasts gave them the
first notion of a model. But the ambition of Carthage
grew as her wealth increased; and how difficult a
task is it to set bounds to that restless passion! thus
by grasping at too much, she lost all. It is not probable
therefore that the Romans would ever have
attempted to disturb any of the Carthaginian settlements,
when the whole coast of Italy lay open to the
insults and depredations of so formidable a maritime
power. The Romans felt this so sensibly in the
beginning of the first Punick war, that they never
rested until they had acquired the superiority at sea.
It is evident too, that the Romans always maintained
that superiority: for if Hannibal could possibly have
passed by sea into Italy, so able a general would
never have harrassed his troops by that long and
seemingly impossible march over the Alps, which
cost him above half his army; an expedition which
has been, and ever will be, the wonder of all succeed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>ing
ages. Nor could Scipio have landed without
opposition so very near the city of Carthage itself, if
the maritime force of that people had not been at the
very lowest ebb.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians were certainly greatly weakened
by the long continuance of their first war with the
Romans, and that savage and destructive war with
their own mercenaries, which followed immediately
after. They ought therefore, in true policy, to have
turned their whole attention, during the interval
between the first and second Punick wars, to the re-establishment
of their marine; but the conquest of
Spain was their favourite object, and their finances
were too much reduced to be sufficient for both.
Thus they expended that money in carrying on a
continental war, which would have put their marine
on so formidable a footing, as to have enabled them
to regain once more the dominion of the sea; and the
fatal event of the second Punick war convinced
them of the false step they had taken, when it was
too late to retrieve it.</p>

<p>I have here pointed out one capital error of the
Carthaginians as a maritime power, I mean their
engaging in too frequent, and too extensive wars on
the continent of Europe, and their neglect of their
marine. I shall now mention another, which more
than once brought them to the very brink of destruction.
This was ... their constantly employing such a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
vast number of foreign mercenary troops, and not
trusting the defence of their country, nay not even
Carthage itself wholly, to their own native subjects.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians were so entirely devoted to
commerce, that they seem to have looked upon every
native employed in their armies as a member lost to
the community; and their wealth enabled them to
buy whatever number of soldiers they pleased from
their neighbouring states in Greece and Africa, who
traded (as I may term it) in war as much as the
Swiss and Germans do now, and were equally ready
to sell the blood and lives of their subjects to the best
bidder. From hence they drew such inexhaustible
supplies of men, both to form and recruit their
armies, whilst their own natives were at leisure to
follow the more lucrative occupations of navigation,
husbandry, and mechanick trades. For the number
of native Carthaginians, which we read of, in any of
their armies, was so extremely small as to bear no
proportion to that of their foreign mercenaries.
This kind of policy, which prevails so generally in
all mercantile states, does, I confess, at first sight
appear extremely plausible. The Carthaginians, by
this method, spared their own people, and purchased
all their conquests by the venal blood of foreigners:
and, in case of a defeat, they could with great ease
and expedition recruit their broken armies with any
number of good troops, ready trained up to their
hands in military discipline. But alas, these advantages
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
were greatly over-balanced by very fatal inconveniences.
The foreign troops were attached to the
Carthaginians by no tie, but that of their pay. Upon
the least failure of that, or if they were not humoured
in all their licentious demands, they were
just as ready to turn their arms against the throats
of their masters. Strangers to that heartfelt affection,
that enthusiastick love of their country which
warms the hearts of free citizens, and fires them with
the glorious emulation of fighting to the last drop of
blood in defence of their common mother; these
sordid hirelings were always ripe for mutiny and
sedition, and ever ready to revolt and change sides
upon the least prospect of greater advantages.</p>

<p>But a short detail of the calamities, which they
drew upon themselves by this mistaken policy, will
better show the dangers which attend the admission
of foreign mercenaries into any country, where the
natives are unaccustomed to the use of arms. A
practice which is too apt to prevail in commercial
nations.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the first Punick war the Carthaginians
were compelled, by their treaty with the
Romans, to evacuate Sicily. Gesco therefore, who
then commanded in that island, to prevent the disorders
which might be committed by such a multitude
of desperate fellows, composed of so many different
nations, and so long inured to blood and rapine,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
sent them over gradually in small bodies, that his
countrymen might have time to pay off their arrears,
and send them home to their respective countries.
But either the lowness of their finances, or the ill
timed parsimony of the Carthaginians totally defeated
this salutary measure,<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> though the wisest that, as
their affairs were at that time circumstanced, could
possibly have been taken. The Carthaginians deferred
their payment until the arrival of the whole
body, in hopes of obtaining some abatement in their
demands by fairly laying before them the necessities
of the publick. But the mercenaries were deaf to
every representation and proposal of that nature.
They felt their own strength, and saw too plainly the
weakness of their masters. As fast as one demand
was agreed to, a more unreasonable one was started;
and they threatened to do themselves justice by
military execution if their exorbitant demands were
not immediately complied with. At last, when they
were just at the point of an accommodation with their
masters, by the mediation and address of Gesco, two
desperate ruffians, named Speudius and Mathos,<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>
raised such a flame amongst this unruly multitude
as broke out instantly into the most bloody, and destructive
war ever yet recorded in history. The account
we have of it from the Greek historians must
strike the most callous breast with horror; and
though it was at last happily terminated by the superior
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
conduct of Hamilcar Barcas, the father of the
great Hannibal, yet it continued near four years, and
left the territories around Carthage a most shocking
scene of blood and devastation. Such was, and ever
will be the consequence, when a large body of mercenary
troops is admitted into the heart of a rich
and fertile country, where the bulk of the people
are denied the use of arms by the mistaken policy of
their governors. For this was actually the case
with the Carthaginians, where the total disuse of
arms amongst the lower class of people, laid that
opulent country open, an easy and tempting prey to
every invader. This was another capital error, and
consequently another cause which contributed to
their ruin.</p>

<p>How must any nation but our own, which with
respect to the bulk of the people, lies in the same
defenceless situation; how, I say, must they censure
the mighty state of Carthage, spreading terror, and
giving law to the most distant nations by her powerful
fleets, when they see her at the same time
trembling, and giving herself up for lost at the landing
of any invader in her own territories?</p>

<p>The conduct of that petty prince Agathocles,
affords us a striking instance of the defenceless state
of the territories of Carthage. The Carthaginians
were at that very time masters of all Sicily, except
the single city of Syracuse, in which they had cooped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
up that tyrant both by land and sea. Agathocles,
reduced to the last extremity, struck perhaps the
boldest stroke ever yet met with in history.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> He
was perfectly well acquainted with the weak side of
Carthage, and knew that he could meet with little
opposition from a people who were strangers to the
use of arms, and enervated by a life of ease and
plenty. On this defect of their policy he founded
his hopes; and the event proved that he was not
mistaken in his judgment. He embarked with only
thirteen thousand men on board the few ships he
had remaining, eluded the vigilance of the Carthaginian
fleet by stratagem, landed safely in Africa,
plundered and ravaged that rich country up to the
very gates of Carthage, which he closely blocked up,
and reduced nearly to the situation in which he had
left his own Syracuse. Nothing could equal the
terror into which the city of Carthage was thrown at
that time, but the panick which, in the late rebellion,
struck the much larger, and more populous
city of London, at the approach of a poor handful of
Highlanders, as much inferior even to the small
army of Agathocles in number, as they were in arms
and discipline. The success of that able leader
compelled the Carthaginians to recall part of their
forces out of Sicily to the immediate defence of
Carthage itself; and this occasioned the raising of the
siege of Syracuse, and ended in the total defeat of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
their army, and death of their general in that country.
Thus Agathocles, by this daring measure,
saved his own petty state, and, after a variety of
good and ill fortune, concluded a treaty with the
Carthaginians, and died at Syracuse at a time when,
from a thorough experience of their defenceless
state at home, he was preparing for a fresh invasion.</p>

<p>Livy informs us, that this very measure of Agathocles
set the precedent which Scipio followed with
so much success in the second Punick war, when
that able general, by a similar descent in Africa,
compelled the Carthaginians to recall Hannibal out
of Italy to their immediate assistance, and reduced
them to that impotent state, from which they never
afterwards were able to recover.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> How successfully
the French played the same game upon us, when
they obliged us to recall our forces out of Flanders
to crush the rebellion, which they had spirited up
with that very view, is a fact too recent to need any
mention of particulars. How lately did they drive
us to the expense, and I may say the ignominy, of
fetching over a large body of foreign mercenaries
for the immediate defence of this nation, which
plumes herself so much upon her power and bravery?
How greatly did they cramp all our measures,
how much did they confine all our military
operations to our own immediate self-defence, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
prevent us from sending sufficient succours to our
colonies by the perpetual alarm of an invasion?</p>

<p>Though we may in part truly ascribe the ruin of
Carthage to the two above-mentioned errors in their
policy, yet the cause which was productive of the
greatest evils, and consequently the more immediate
object of our attention at this dangerous juncture,
was party disunion; that bane of every free
state, from which our own country has equal reason
to apprehend the same direful effects, as the republicks
of Greece, Rome, and Carthage experienced
formerly.</p>

<p>By all the lights, which we receive from history,
the state of Carthage was divided into two opposite
factions; the Hannonian and the Barcan, so denominated
from the respective leaders, who were heads
of the two most powerful families in Carthage. The
Hannonian family seems to have made the greatest
figure in the senate; the Barcan in the field. Both
were strongly actuated by ambition, but ambition of
a different kind. The Barcan family seems to have
had no other object in view but the glory of their
country, and were always ready to give up their
private animosities, and even their passion for military
glory to the publick good. The Hannonian
family acted from quite opposite principles, constantly
aiming at one point; the supporting themselves
in power, and that only. Ever jealous of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
glory acquired by the Barcan family, they perpetually
thwarted every measure proposed from that
quarter, and were equally ready to sacrifice the
honour and real interest of their country to that
selfish view. In short, the one family seems to
have produced a race of heroes, the other of ambitious
statesmen.</p>

<p>The chiefs of these two jarring families, best
known to us in history, were Hanno and Hamilcar
Barcas, who was succeeded by his son Hannibal, that
terror of the Romans. The opposition between these
two parties was so flagrant, that Appian does not
scruple to call the party of Hanno, the Roman
faction;<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> and that of Barcas, the popular, or the Carthaginian,
from the different interests which each
party espoused.</p>

<p>The first instance, which we meet with in history,
of the enmity subsisting between the heads of these
factions, was in that destructive war with the Mercenaries,
from which I have made this explanatory
digression.</p>

<p>Hanno was first sent with a powerful, and well
provided army against these mutinous desperadoes;
but he knew little of his trade, and made perpetual
blunders. Polybius,<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> who treats his character, as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
soldier, with the utmost contempt, informs us, that
he suffered himself to be surprised, a great part of
his fine army to be cut to pieces, and his camp taken,
with all the military stores, engines, and all the
other apparatus of war.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians, terrified and distressed by the
bad conduct of their general, were now compelled,
by the necessity of their affairs, to restore Hamilcar
to the chief command of their forces, from which
he must have been excluded before by the influence
of the Hannonian faction. That able commander
with his small army (for his whole force amounted
to no more than ten thousand men) quickly changed
the face of the war, defeated Spendius in two pitched
battles, and pushed every advantage to the utmost,
which the incapacity of the rebel-generals threw in
his way. Sensible that he was too weak alone to
cope with the united forces of the rebels (which
amounted to seventy thousand men) he ordered
Hanno (who had still influence enough to procure
himself to be continued in the command of a separate
body) to join him, that they might finish this
execrable war by one decisive action.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> After they
were joined, the Carthaginians soon felt the fatal
effects of disunion between their generals. No plan
could now be followed, no measure could be agreed
on;<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> and the disagreement between these two leading
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
men arose to such a height at last, that they
not only let slip every opportunity of annoying the
enemy, but gave them many advantages against
themselves, which they could not otherwise have
hoped for. The Carthaginians,<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> sensible of their
error, and knowing the very different abilities of the
two generals, yet willing to avoid the imputation of
partiality, empowered the army to decide which of
the two they judged most proper for their general,
as they were determined to continue only one of
them in the command. The decision of the army
was,<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> that Hamilcar should take the supreme command,
and that Hanno should depart the camp. A
convincing proof that they threw the whole blame
of that disunion, and the ill-success, which was the
consequence of it, entirely upon the envy and jealousy
of Hanno. One Hannibal, a man more tractable,
and more agreeable to Hamilcar, was sent in
his room. Union was restored, and the happy effects
which attended it were quickly visible. Hamilcar
now pushed on the war with his usual vigilance and
activity, and soon convinced the generals of the
rebels how greatly he was their master in the art of
war. He harrassed them perpetually, and, like a
skilful gamester,<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> (as Polybius terms him) drew
them artfully every day into his snares, and obliged
them to raise the siege of Carthage. At last he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
cooped up Spendius with his army in so disadvantageous
a place, that he reduced them to such an
extremity of famine as to devour one another, and
compelled them to surrender at discretion, though
they were upwards of forty thousand effective men....
The army of Hamilcar, which was much inferior to
that of Spendius in number, was composed partly of
mercenaries and deserters, partly of the city militia,
both horse and foot (troops which the enemies to
the militia-bill would have called raw and undisciplined,
and treated as useless) of which the major
part of his army consisted.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> The rebel army was
composed chiefly of brave and experienced veterans,
trained up by Hamilcar himself in Sicily during the
late war with the Romans, whose courage was heightened
by despair. It is worthy of our observation therefore,
that these very men who, under the conduct of
Hamilcar, had been a terror to the Romans, and
given them so many blows in Sicily towards the
latter end of the first Punick war, should yet be so
little able to cope with an army so much inferior in
number, and composed in a great measure of city
militia only, when commanded by the same general.
Polybius,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> who esteems Hamilcar by far the greatest
captain of that age, observes, that though the rebels
were by no means inferior to the Carthaginian troops
in resolution and bravery, yet they were frequently
beaten by Hamilcar by mere dint of generalship.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Upon this occasion he cannot help remarking the
vast superiority which judicious skill and ability of
generalship has over long military practice,<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> where
this so essentially necessary skill and judgement is
wanting. It might have been thought unpardonable
in me, if I had omitted this just remark of Polybius,
since it has been so lately verified by his Prussian
majesty in those masterly strokes of generalship,
which are the present admiration of Europe. Hamilcar,
after the destruction of Spendius and his
army, immediately blocked up Mathos, with the
remaining corps of the rebels, in the city of Tunes.
Hannibal, with the forces under his command, took
post on that side of the city which looked towards
Carthage. Hamilcar prepared to make his attack
on the side which was directly opposite; but the
conduct of Hannibal, when left to himself, was the
direct contrast to that of Hamilcar, and proves undeniably,
that the whole merit of their former success
was entirely owing to that abler general. Hannibal,
who seems to have been little acquainted with the
true genius of those daring veterans, lay secure, and
careless in his camp, neglected his out-guards, and
treated the enemy with contempt, as a people already
conquered. But Mathos observing the negligence
and security of Hannibal,<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> and well knowing
that he had not Hamilcar to deal with, made a sudden
and resolute sally, forced Hannibal intrenchments,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
put great numbers of his men to the sword,
took Hannibal himself, with several other persons
of distinction prisoners, and pillaged his camp.
This daring measure was so well concerted, and
executed with so much rapidity, that Mathos, who
made good use of his time, had done his business
before Hamilcar, who lay encamped at some distance,
was in the least apprized of his colleague&#8217;s misfortune.
Mathos fastened Hannibal, whilst alive, on
the same gibbet to which Hamilcar had lately nailed
the body of Spendius: A terrible, but just reward
for the shameful carelessness in a commanding officer,
who had sacrificed the lives of such a number
of his fellow citizens by his own indolence and presumptuous
folly. For Mathos crucified thirty of the
first nobility of Carthage, who attended Hannibal in
this expedition. A commander who is surprised
in the night-time, though guilty of an egregious
fault, may yet plead something in excuse; but, in
point of discipline, for a general to be surprised by
an enemy just under his nose in open daylight, and
caught in a state of wanton security, from an over-weening
presumption on his own strength, is a
crime of so capital a nature as to admit neither of
alleviation nor pardon. This dreadful and unexpected
blow threw Carthage into the utmost consternation,
and obliged Hamilcar to draw off his part of
the army to a considerable distance from Tunes.
Hanno had again influence enough to procure the
command, which he was compelled before by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
army to give up to Hamilcar. But the Carthaginians,
sensible of the fatal consequences of disunion
between the two generals, especially at such a desperate
crisis, sent thirty of the most respectable
amongst the senators to procure a thorough reconciliation
between Hamilcar and Hanno before they
proceeded upon any operation;<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> which they effected
at last, though not without difficulty. Pleased with
this happy event, the Carthaginians (as their last,
and utmost effort) sent every man in Carthage,<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>
who was able to bear arms, to re-enforce Hamilcar,
on whose superior abilities they placed their whole
dependance. Hamilcar now resumed his operations,
and, as he was no longer thwarted by Hanno, soon
reduced Mathos to the necessity of putting the
whole issue of the war upon one decisive action,
in which the Carthaginians were most completely
victors by the exquisite disposition and conduct of
Hamilcar.</p>

<p>I hope the enemies to a militia will at least allow
these new levies, who composed by far the greatest
part of Hamilcar&#8217;s army upon this occasion, to be
raw, undisciplined, and ignorant of the use of arms;
epithets which they bestow so plentifully upon a
militia. Yet that able commander, with an army
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
consisting chiefly of this kind of men, totally destroyed
an army of desperate veterans, took their
general, and all who escaped the slaughter prisoners,
and put an end to the most ruinous, and most inhuman
war ever yet mentioned in history. These
new levies had courage (a quality never yet, I believe,
disputed to the British commonality) and were to
fight <i>pro aris et focis</i>, for whatever was dear and
valuable to a people; and Hamilcar, who well knew
how to make the proper use of these dispositions of
his countrymen, was master of those abilities which
Mathos wanted. Of such infinite advantage is it to
an army to have a commander superior to the enemy
in the art of generalship; an advantage which
frequently supplies a deficiency even in the goodness
of troops, as well as in numbers.</p>

<p>The enmity of Hanno did not expire with Hamilcar,
who fell gloriously in the service of his country,
in Spain some years after. Hannibal the eldest son,
and a son worthy of so heroick a father, immediately
became the object of his jealousy and hatred. For
when Asdrubal (son-in-law to Hamilcar) had been
appointed to the command of the army in Spain, after
the death of that general, he desired that Hannibal,
at that time but twenty-two years of age, might be
sent to Spain to be trained up under him in the art
of war. Hanno opposed this with the utmost virulence
in a rancorous speech (made for him by Livy)
fraught with the most infamous insinuations against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Asdrubal, and a strong charge of ambition against
the Barcan family. But his malice, and the true
reason of his opposition, varnished over with a specious
concern for the publick welfare, were so easily
seen through, that he was not able to carry a point
which he so much wished for.</p>

<p>Asdrubal not long after being assassinated by a
Gaul,<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> in revenge for some injury he had received,
the army immediately appointed Hannibal to the
command; and sending advice to Carthage of what
they had done, the senate was assembled, who unanimously
confirmed the election then made by the
soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> Hannibal in a short time reduced all that
part of Spain which lay between New Carthage and
the river Iberus, except the city of Saguntum, which
was in alliance with the Romans. But as he inherited
his father&#8217;s hatred to the Romans, for their infamous
behaviour to his country at the conclusion of the
war with the mercenaries,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> he made great preparations
for the siege of Saguntum. The Romans
(according to Polybius) receiving intelligence of his
design,<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> sent ambassadors to him at New Carthage,
who warned him of the consequences of either
attacking the Saguntines, or crossing the Iberus,
which, by the treaty with Asdrubal, had been made
the boundary of the Carthaginian and Roman dominions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
in that country. Hannibal acknowledged his
resolution to proceed against Saguntum, but the reasons
he assigned for his conduct were so unsatisfactory
to the ambassadors, that they crossed over to
Carthage to know the resolution of their senate upon
that subject. Hannibal in the mean time, according
to the same author,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> sent advice to Carthage of this
embassy, and desired instructions how to act, complaining
heavily that the Saguntines depending upon
their alliance with the Romans, committed frequent
depredations upon the Carthaginian subjects.</p>

<p>We may conclude that the ambassadors met with
as disagreeable a reception from the Carthaginian
senate as they had done from Hannibal, and that he
received orders from Carthage to proceed in his
intended expedition. For Polybius,<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> reflecting upon
some writers, who pretended to relate what passed
in the Roman senate when the news arrived of
the capture of Saguntum, and even inserted the debates
which arose when the question was put, whether, or
no, war should be declared against Carthage, treats
their whole accounts as absurd and fictitious. &#8220;For
how, says he, with indignation, could it possibly be,
that the Romans, who had denounced war the year
before at Carthage, if Hannibal should invade the
Saguntine territories, should now after that city was
taken by storm assemble to deliberate, whether war
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
should be commenced against the Carthaginians or
not.&#8221; Now as this declaration of war was conditional,
and not to take place unless Hannibal should attack
the Saguntines, it must have been made before that
event happened, and consequently must be referred
to the embassy above-mentioned. And as Hannibal
undertook the siege of Saguntum notwithstanding
the Roman menaces, he undoubtedly acted by orders
from the Carthaginian senate.</p>

<p>When the Romans received the news of the destruction
of Saguntum, they dispatched another embassy
to Carthage (as Polybius relates) with the
utmost expedition;<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> their orders were to insist that
Hannibal and all who advised him to commit hostilities
against the Saguntines should be delivered up
to the Romans, and in case of a refusal, to declare
immediate war. Their demand was received by the
Carthaginian senate with the utmost indignation,
and one of the senators, who was appointed to speak
in the name of the rest, begun in an artful speech to
recriminate upon the Romans, and offered to prove,
that the Saguntines were not allied to the Romans
when the peace was made between the two nations,
and consequently could not be included in the treaty.
But the Romans cut the affair short, and told them
that they did not come there to dispute, but only to
insist upon a categorical answer to this plain question:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
whether they would give up the authors of the
hostilities, which would convince the world that they
had no share in the destruction of Saguntum, but
that Hannibal had done it without their authority; or,
whether by protecting them, they chose to confirm
the Romans in the belief, that Hannibal had acted
with their approbation? As their demand of Hannibal
was refused, war was declared by the Romans,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> and
accepted with equal alacrity and fierceness by the
majority of the Carthaginian senate.</p>

<p>Livy affirms that the first embassy was decreed
by the Roman senate,<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> but not sent until Hannibal
had actually invested Saguntum, and varies from
Polybius in his relation of the particulars. For according
to Livy,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> Hannibal received intelligence of
the Roman embassy, but he sent them word, that he
had other business upon his hands at that time than
to give audience to ambassadors, and that he wrote
at the same time to his friends of the Barcan faction
to exert themselves, and prevent the other party
from carrying any point in favour of the Romans.</p>

<p>The ambassadors, thus denied admittance by Hannibal,
repaired to Carthage and laid their demands
before the senate. Upon this occasion Livy introduces
Hanno inveighing bitterly in a formal harangue
against the sending Hannibal into Spain, a measure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
which he foretells, must terminate in the utter destruction
of Carthage.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> And after testifying his joy
for the death of his father Hamilcar, whom he acknowledges
he most cordially hated, as he did
the whole Barcan family, whom he terms the fire-brands
of the state, he advises them to give up
Hannibal, and make full satisfaction for the injury
then done to the Saguntines. When Hanno had
done speaking, there was no occasion, as Livy
observes, for a reply.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> For almost all the senate
were so entirely in the interest of Hannibal, that
they accused Hanno of declaiming against him,
with more bitterness and rancour than even the
Roman ambassadors, who were dismissed with this
short answer, &#8220;that not Hannibal, but the Saguntines,
were the authors of the war, and that the
Romans treated them with great injustice, if they
preferred the friendship of the Saguntines before that
of their most ancient allies the Carthaginians.&#8221;
Livy&#8217;s account of the second embassy, which followed
the destruction of Saguntum, differs so very
little from that of Polybius, both as to the question
put by the Romans, the answer given by the Carthaginian
senate, and the declaration of war which
was the consequence, that it is needless to repeat it.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>If what Hanno said in the speech above-mentioned,
had been his real sentiments from any consciousness
of the superior power of the Romans, and the imprudence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
of engaging in a war of that consequence
before his country had recovered her former strength,
he would have acted upon principles worthy of an
honest and prudent patriot. For Polybius,<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> after
enumerating the superior excellencies of Hannibal
as a general, is strongly of opinion, that if he had
begun with other nations, and left the Romans for
his last enterprise, he would certainly have succeeded
in whatever he had attempted against them,
but he miscarried by attacking those first, whom he
ought to have reserved for his last enterprise. The
subsequent behaviour of Hanno, during the whole
time that Italy was the seat of war, evidently proves,
that his opposition to this war proceeded entirely
from party motives, and his personal hatred to the
Barcan family, consequently is by no means to be
ascribed to any regard for the true interest of his
country. Appian informs us,<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> that when Fabius had
greatly streightened Hannibal by his cautious conduct,
the Carthaginian general sent a pressing message
to Carthage for a supply both of men and
money. But according to that author, he was flatly
refused, and could obtain neither, by the influence of
his enemies, who were averse to that war, and
cavilled perpetually at every enterprise which Hannibal
undertook. Livy,<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> in his relation of the account,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
which Hannibal sent to the Carthaginian senate of
his glorious victory at Cann&aelig; by his brother Mago,
with the demand for a large re-enforcement of men
as well as money, introduces Hanno (in a speech of
his own which he gives us on that occasion) strongly
opposing that motion, and persisting still in his
former sentiments in respect both to the war and to
Hannibal. But the Carthaginians, elated with that
victory, which was the greatest blow the Romans
ever received in the field since the foundation of
their republick, and thoroughly sensible (as Livy
informs us) of the enmity which Hanno and his faction
bore to the Barcan family, immediately decreed
a supply of forty thousand Numidians, and twenty-four
thousand foot and horse to be immediately
levied in Spain, besides elephants, and a very large
sum of money. Though Hanno at that time had not
weight enough in the senate to prevent that decree,
yet he had influence enough by his intrigues to
retard the supply then voted, and not only to get it
reduced to twelve thousand foot and twenty-five
hundred horse, but even to procure that small number
to be sent to Spain upon a different service.
That Hanno was the true cause of this cruel disappointment,
and the fatal consequences which attended
it, is equally evident from the same historian.
For Livy tells us,<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> &#8220;that when orders were sent to
him by the Carthaginian senate to quit Italy, and hasten
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
to the immediate defence of his own country,
Hannibal inveighed bitterly against the malice of his
enemies, who now openly and avowedly recalled him
from Italy, out of which they had long before endeavoured
to drag him, when they tied up his hands
by constantly refusing him any supply either of men
or money. That Hannibal affirmed he was not conquered
by the Romans, whom he had so often
defeated, but by the calumny and envy of the opposite
faction in the senate. That Scipio would not
have so much reason to plume himself upon the
ignominy of his return, as his enemy Hanno, who
was so implacably bent upon the destruction of the
Barcan family, that since he was not able to crush it
by any other means, he had at last accomplished it,
though by the ruin of Carthage itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had that large supply been sent to Hannibal with
the same unanimity and despatch with which it was
voted, it is more than probable, that so consummate
a general would have soon been master of Rome,
and transferred the empire of the world to Carthage.
For the Romans were so exhausted after the terrible
defeat at Cann&aelig;, that Livy is of opinion, that Hannibal
would have given the finishing blow to that republick,
if he had marched directly to Rome from the
field of battle, as he was advised to do by his general
of horse Maherbal.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> That many of the nobility upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the first news of this fatal event, were in actual
consultation about the means of quitting Italy, and
looking out for a settlement in some other part of the
world, and he affirms, that the safety both of the city
and empire of Rome must be attributed (as it was then
firmly believed at Rome) to the delay of that single
day only, on which Maherbal gave that advice to
Hannibal. Appian confirms the distressful situation
of the Roman affairs at that juncture, and informs
us, that including the slaughter at Cann&aelig;, in which
the Romans had lost most of their ablest officers,
Hannibal had put to the sword two hundred and fifty
thousand of their best troops in the space of two
years only, from the beginning of the second Punick
war inclusive.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> It is easy, therefore, to imagine how
little able the Roman armies, consisting chiefly of
new levies, would have been to face such a commander
as Hannibal, when supported by the promised
re-enforcement of sixty-four thousand fresh
men, besides money and elephants in proportion.
For Hannibal, though deprived of all supplies from
Carthage by the malice of the Hannonian faction,
maintained his ground above fourteen years more
after his victory at Cann&aelig;, in spite of the utmost
efforts of the Romans. A truth which Livy himself
acknowledges with admiration and astonishment at
his superior military capacity. From that period
therefore, after the battle of Cann&aelig;, when Hannibal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
was first disappointed of the promised supplies from
Carthage, we ought properly to date the fall of that
republick, which must be wholly imputed to the
inveterate malice of the profligate Hanno and his impious
faction, who were determined, as Hannibal
observed before, to ruin the contrary party, though
by means which must be inevitably attended with
the destruction of their country. Appian insinuates,<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a>
that Hannibal first engaged in this war more from
the importunity of his friends, than even his own
passion for military glory and hereditary hatred to
the Romans. For Hanno and his faction (as Appian
tells us) no longer dreading the power of Hamilcar
and Asdrubal his son-in-law,<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> and holding Hannibal
extremely cheap upon account of his youth, began
to persecute and oppress the Barcan party with so
much rage and hatred, that the latter were obliged
by letter to implore assistance from Hannibal, and
to assure him that his own interest and safety
was inseparable from theirs. Hannibal (as Appian
adds) was conscious of the truth of this remark,
and well knew that the blows, which seemed
directed at his friends, were levelled in reality at
his own head, and judged that a war with the
Romans, which would be highly agreeable to the
generality of his countrymen, might prove the
surest means of counter-working his enemies, and
preserving himself and his friends from the fury
of a pliant and fickle populace, already inflamed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
against his party by the intrigues of Hanno. He
concluded therefore, according to Appian, that a war
with so formidable and dangerous a power, would
divert the Carthaginians from all inquiries relative to
his friends, and oblige them to attend wholly to an
affair, which was of the last importance to their
country. Should Appian&#8217;s account of the cause of
this war be admitted as true, it would be a yet
stronger proof of the calamitous effects of party
disunion; though it would by no means excuse
Hannibal. For Hanno and his party would be equally
culpable for driving a man of Hannibal&#8217;s abilities to
such a desperate measure, purely to screen himself
and his party from their malice and power. But the
blame for not supporting Hannibal after the battle of
Cann&aelig;, when such support would have enabled him
to crush that power, which by their means recovered
strength sufficient to subvert their own country, must
be thrown entirely upon Hanno and his party. It
was a crime of the blackest dye, and an act of the
highest treason against their country, and another
terrible proof of the fatal effects of party disunion.
Nor was this evil peculiar to Carthage only, but was
equally common in the Roman and Grecian republicks.
Nay, could we trace all our publick measures
up to their first secret springs of action, I do not
doubt (notwithstanding the plausible reasons which
might have been given to the publick to palliate
such measures) but we should find our own country
rashly engaged in wars detrimental to her true
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
interests, or obliged to submit to a disadvantageous
peace, just as either was conducive to the private
interest of the prevailing party. Will not our own
annals furnish us with some memorable instances
of the truth of this assertion too recent to be denied?
was not the treatment which the great duke of
Marlborough received from Bolingbroke, the English
Hanno, parallel to that which the victorious
Hannibal met with from the Carthaginian, after the
battle of Cann&aelig;? did not Bolingbroke, from the
worst of party motives, displace that ever victorious
general, desert our allies, and sacrifice the brave
and faithful Catalans, and the city of Barcelona, in
at least as shameful a manner as the Romans did
their unhappy friends at Saguntum? did not the
same minister by the fatal treaty of Utrecht, rob the
nation of all those advantages, which she had reason
to hope for from a long and successful war? did he
not by the same treaty, give our mortal enemy
France time to retrieve her affairs, and recover from
that low state to which the duke of Marlborough
had reduced her, and even to arrive at that power, at
present so terrible to us and to all Europe?</p>

<p>To what can we attribute the late ill conducted
war with Spain, but to the ambition of party. How
was the nation stunned with the noise of Spanish
depredations from the press! how loudly did the
same outcry resound in parliament! yet when the
leaders of that powerful opposition had carried their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
point by their popular clamours; when they had
pushed the nation into that war; when they had
drove an overgrown minister from the helm, and
nestled themselves in power, how quickly did they
turn their backs upon the honest men of their party,
who refused to concur in their measures! how soon
did they convince the nation, by screening that very
minister who had been so many years the object of
their resentment, and by carrying on their own war
(as I may term it) with the same or greater lukewarmness
than what they had so lately exclaimed
against in the same minister. They convinced, I
say, the whole nation, that the welfare of the publick,
and the protection of our trade, had not the least
share in the real motives of their conduct.</p>

<p>But as the Carthaginian history, during this period,
is intimately blended with the Roman, to avoid
repetition, I am obliged to defer my farther remarks
upon the conduct of this people, until I speak of the
difference between the civil and military polity, and
manners of both those nations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br /><br />

<small>OF ROME.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> there is a concurrence of several causes
which bring on the ruin of a state, yet where luxury
prevails, that parent of all our fantastick imaginary
wants, ever craving and ever unsatisfied, we may
justly assign it as the leading cause: since it ever
was and ever will be the most baneful to publick
virtue. For as luxury is contagious from its very
nature, it will gradually descend from the highest to
the lowest ranks, until it has ultimately infected a
whole people. The evils arising from luxury have
not been peculiar to this or that nation, but equally
fatal to all wherever it was admitted. Political philosophy
lays this down as a fundamental and incontestable
maxim,<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> that all the most flourishing states
owed their ruin, sooner or later, to the effects of
luxury; and all history, from the origin of mankind,
confirms this truth by the evidence of facts to the
highest degree of demonstration. In the great despotick
monarchies it produced avarice, dissipation, rapaciousness,
oppression, perpetual factions amongst
the great, whilst each endeavoured to engross the
favour of the prince wholly to himself; venality, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
a contempt of all law and discipline both in the
military and civil departments. Whilst the people,
following the pernicious example of their superiors,
contracted such a dastardly effeminacy, joined to an
utter inability to support the fatigues of war, as
quickly threw them into the hands of the first resolute
invader. Thus the Assyrian empire sunk under
the arms of Cyrus with his poor but hardy Persians.
The extensive and opulent empire of Persia fell an
easy conquest to Alexander and a handful of Macedonians;
and the Macedonian empire, when enervated
by the luxury of Asia, was compelled to receive the
yoke of the victorious Romans.</p>

<p>Luxury, when introduced into free states, and
suffered to be diffused without controul through the
body of the people, was ever productive of that
degeneracy of manners, which extinguished publick
virtue, and put a final period to liberty. For as the
incessant demands of luxury quickly induced necessity,
that necessity kept human invention perpetually
on the rack to find out ways and means to supply
the demands of luxury. Hence the lower classes at
first sold their suffrages in privacy and with caution;
but as luxury increased, and the manners of the
people grew daily more corrupt, they openly set
them up to sale to the best bidder. Hence too the
ambitious amongst the higher classes, whose superior
wealth was frequently their only qualification,
first purchased the most lucrative posts in the state
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
by this infamous kind of traffick, and then maintained
themselves in power by that additional fund
for corruption, which their employments supplied,
until they had undone those they had first corrupted.</p>

<p>But of all the ancient republicks, Rome in the last
period of her freedom was the scene where all the
inordinate passions of mankind operated most powerfully
and with the greatest latitude. There we
see luxury, ambition, faction, pride, revenge, selfishness,
a total disregard to the publick good, and an
universal dissoluteness of manners, first make them
ripe for, and then complete their destruction. Consequently
that period, by showing us more striking
examples, will afford us more useful lessons than any
other part of their history.</p>

<p>Rome, once the mighty mistress of the universe,
owed her rise, according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
the most curious and most exact inquirer
into the Roman antiquities, to a small colony of the
Albans under the conduct of Romulus, the supposed
grandson of Numitor king of Alba. That the Albans
derived their origin from the Greeks seems highly
probable from the nature of the Alban and Roman
monarchical government, which appears to be plainly
copied from Lycurgus.</p>

<p>The government first instituted by Romulus, the
founder of this extraordinary empire, was that perfect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
sort, as it is termed by Dionysius and Polybius,
which consisted of a due admixture of the regal,
aristocratick, and democratick powers. As this
great man received the crown as a reward for his
superior merit, and held it by the best of all titles,
the willing and unanimous choice of a free people;
and as he is universally allowed to be the sole institutor
of their first form of government, I cannot help
ranking him amongst the most celebrated lawgivers
and heroes of antiquity. Romulus&#8217;s plan of government,
though formed upon the model of Lycurgus,
was evidently, in some respects, superior to the
Spartan. For the executive power in the Roman
government was lodged in one man only; the number
of the senators was much greater, and though
the whole body of the Romans was formed into one
regular militia, yet the lowest class of the people
were directed to apply themselves to agriculture,
grazing, and other lucrative employments; a practice
wholly prohibited to the free Spartans. The great
employments of the state were solely confined to
the Patricians, or aristocratick part; but the Plebeians,
or commonalty, had in return the power
of choosing magistrates, enacting laws, and determining
about all wars when proposed by the king.
But still their decrees were not final, for the concurrence
of the senate was absolutely necessary to give
a sanction to whatever the people had determined.</p>

<p>Whether the Romans would have continued the
regal power in their founder&#8217;s family by hereditary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
succession, cannot possibly be determined, because,
when Romulus was put to death by the Patricians
for aiming at more power than was consistent with
their limited monarchy, he left no children. This
however is certain, that their monarchy continued
to be elective, and was attended with those disorders
which are the usual effects of that capital error in
politicks, until the usurpation of Tarquinius Superbus.</p>

<p>After the death of Romulus, Numa, a man of a
very different genius, was invited to the throne by
the unanimous consent of the whole body of the
Romans. This worthy prince reclaimed his subjects
from their savage fondness for war and plunder,
and taught them the arts of peace, and the happiness
of civil and social life, by instructing them
in the great duties of religion, or piety towards
their gods, and the laws of justice and humanity,
which contained their duty towards their fellow creatures.
The long reign of this wise and good prince
was the most remarkable, and the most happy period
of time Rome ever knew from her foundation
to her dissolution. For during the whole term of
forty-three years, which was the extent of his reign,
the harmony of the Roman state was neither interrupted
by any civil dissension at home, nor the happiness
of the people disturbed by any foreign war
or invasion. After the death of Numa, who died
universally lamented as the father of the people,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Tullus Hostilius, a man of real merit, was legally
elected king, but, after a victorious reign of thirty-two
years, was destroyed with his whole family by
lightning, according to some authors, but, according
to others, was murdered by Ancus Marcius, grandson
to Numa by his only daughter, who looked upon
his own right to the crown as prior to Tullus, or
his family. Ancus Marcius however received the
crown by a free election of the people, and died a
natural death after a reign of twenty-four years, in
which he restored such of the religious institutions
of his grandfather Numa as had been neglected
during the reign of his predecessor. He greatly
enlarged the city of Rome itself, and made it a seaport
by fortifying the haven at the mouth of the
river Tiber.</p>

<p>Lucius Tarquinius, a man of Greek extraction by
his father&#8217;s side, and admitted to the privilege of
a Roman citizen under the reign of Ancus Marcius,
was raised to the throne for his uncommon merit,
and showed himself worthy of that high trust, which
was reposed in him by the Romans. He increased
the number of the senators to three hundred, greatly
enlarged their territories, and beautified the city;
and, after an illustrious reign of thirty-eight years,
was assassinated in his palace by the contrivance of
the two sons of Ancus Marcius, who hoped after
his death to recover the kingdom, which their father
had been possessed of. But their scheme was far
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
from succeeding, for Tarquinius was so well beloved
by his people, that the persons who committed the
murder, were executed, and the sons of Ancus banished,
and their estates confiscated. Tullius Servius,
who had married the daughter of Tarquinius, succeeded
to the crown by the artful management of
his mother-in-law, and by the favour of the people,
though without the concurrence either of the senate
or Patricians. Tullius was certainly a man of real
merit, and, as I think, superior in point of abilities
to all the Roman kings, Romulus alone excepted.
But as he seemed to affect a democracy, and was
chiefly supported by the people, he was always disagreeable
to the Patricians, who looked upon his
advancement to the crown as an illegal intrusion.
But as he did most signal services to his country,
during a glorious reign of four and forty years, I
cannot help taking notice of some of his institutions,
without the knowledge of which it is hardly possible
to form a perfect idea of the Roman constitution.</p>

<p>Tullius ordered all the Romans to register their
names and ages, with those of their parents, wives
and children, and the place of their abode, either in
the city or the country. At the same time he enjoined
them to give in upon oath a just valuation
of their effects, on pain of being whipped and
sold for slaves if they failed in registering all these
particulars. From this register he formed his plan
for a regular and general militia, which was invariably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
followed by the Romans, until the time of
Marius. To effect this he divided the whole body
of the citizens into six classes. The first class consisted
of those whose possessions amounted to a
hundred <i>min&aelig;</i>.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> These he armed in the completest
manner, and divided into eighty centuries;
forty of which, composed of the younger men, were
appointed to take the field in time of war; the other
forty were assigned for the defence of the city. To
these eighty centuries of heavy armed foot he added
eighteen centuries of horse, selected out of those
who had the largest estates, and were of distinguished
birth. Thus the first class contained ninety-eight
centuries. The second, third, and fourth
classes consisted each of twenty centuries only, and
were composed of citizens, whose effects were estimated
at seventy-five, fifty, and five and twenty
<i>min&aelig;</i>; and their arms were lighter according to their
respective classes. To the second class he added
two centuries of armourers and axe-men. To the
fourth class two centuries of trumpeters and blowers
on the horn, which contained the martial musick of
the army. The fifth class consisted of those who
were worth twelve <i>min&aelig;</i> and a half, which he divided
into thirty centuries, armed with darts and slings
only, and were properly irregulars. The sixth class,
which was by much the most numerous, was comprehended
in one century only, and consisted of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
poorest citizens, who were exempted from all kind
of taxes, as well as all service in the army.</p>

<p>By this wise disposition the burthen of the war
fell chiefly upon those who were best able to support
it. Thus, for instance, if he wanted to raise twenty
thousand men, he divided that number amongst the
centuries of the first five classes, and ordered each
century to furnish its respective quota. He then
calculated the sum necessary for the support of the
war, which he divided in the same manner amongst
the centuries, and ordered every man to pay in proportion
to his possessions. Hence the rich, who
were fewer in number, but divided into more centuries,
were not only obliged to serve oftener, but to
pay greater taxes. For Tullius thought it just, that
they who had the greatest property at stake should
bear the greatest share of the burden, both in their
persons and fortunes: as he judged it equitable,
that the poor should be exempted from taxes, because
they were in want of the necessaries of life;
and from the service; because the Roman soldiers
served at that time at their own expense; a custom
which continued long after. For the Roman
soldiers received no pay, as Livy informs us,<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> until
the three hundred and forty-eighth year from the
foundation of the city.... As the rich, by this regulation,
were subjected to the greatest share of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
expense and danger, Tullius made them an ample
recompense by throwing the chief power of the government
into their hands, which he effected by the
following scheme, too artful for the penetration of
the common people.</p>

<p>By the fundamental constitution of the Romans,
the electing magistrates, both civil and military, the
enacting or repealing laws, and the declaring war, or
concluding peace, were all determined by the suffrages
of the people. But as the people voted by
their curi&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> into ten of which every tribe was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
divided, the meanest citizen had an equal vote with the
greatest: consequently as the poor were much more
numerous than the rich, they carried every point
by a sure majority. Tullius altered this method,
assembled the people, and took their votes by centuries,
not by curi&aelig;. This artful measure turned
the scale, and transferred the majority to the rich.
For as the votes of the first class were first taken,
the votes of that class, which contained ninety-eight
centuries, if unanimous, always constituted a majority
of three votes, which decided the question without
taking the votes of the five succeeding classes, as
they were in that case wholly useless.</p>

<p>Tullius had married his two daughters to Tarquinius
and Aruns, the grandsons of his predecessor,
whose guardianship he had undertaken during
their minority. But what tie is strong enough to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
restrain ambition! his younger daughter Tullia, the
most ambitious, and most detestable of her sex,
unable to prevail upon her husband Aruns to join
in deposing her father, applied to her brother-in-law
Tarquinius, whose temper was congenial with her
own, and offered to be his wife if he would assert his
just right, as she termed it, and attempt to supplant
her father. The offer was accepted, and the incestuous
match agreed upon, which was soon after
completed by the death of her husband and sister,
who were privately despatched, that there might be
no obstacle remaining. Tarquinius, now the worthy
husband of such a wife, attempted in the senate to
procure the deposition of Tullius, but failing in his
design, at the instigation of his impious wife, he
procured the old king to be openly assassinated in the
street before his palace, and the unnatural Tullia
drove her chariot in triumph over the body of her
murdered father. By this complicated scene of
adultery, murder, and parricide, Tarquin, surnamed
the Proud, forced his way to the throne, and to
usurpation added the most execrable and avowed
tyranny. The Patricians,<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> who had favoured his
usurpation, either from their hatred to Tullius and
the Plebeians, or from the hopes of sharing in the
government, with which, according to Dionysius,
they had been privately allured, were the first who
felt the bloody effects of his arbitrary temper. Not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
only the friends of Tullius, and those whom he
suspected as uneasy under his usurpation, but all
who were distinguished by their superior wealth fell
a sacrifice to his suspicion or avarice. All such
were accused, by his profligate emissaries, of many
fictitious crimes, but particularly of a conspiracy
against his person; the common pretence of all
tyrants. As the tyrant himself sat as judge, all
defence was useless. Some received sentence of
death, some of banishment, and the estates of both
were alike confiscated. The greater number of those
that were accused, knowing the true motives of the
tyrant&#8217;s conduct, and despairing of safety, voluntarily
left the city; but some of the greatest note were
privately murdered by his orders, whose bodies
could never be found. When he had sufficiently
thinned the senate by the death, or banishment of
its most valuable members, he filled up the vacant
seats with his own creatures. But as he allowed
nothing to be proposed or done there, but in conformity
to his orders, he reduced it to an empty
form, without the least shadow of power. The
Plebeians, who beheld with pleasure the sufferings of
the Patricians, which they esteemed a just punishment
for their behaviour under the reign of Tullius,
were quickly treated with much greater severity.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>
For the tyrant not only abolished all the laws which
Tullius had established to secure them against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
oppressions of the Patricians, but loaded them with
ruinous taxes, and prohibited all their publick religious
assemblies, that they might have no opportunity
of meeting to form secret conspiracies. Proceeding
then upon the constant maxim of all tyrants,
that idleness in the people is the parent of sedition,
he exhausted them so much by the slavish drudgery,
in which he kept them constantly employed at the
publick works, that the Patricians rejoiced in their
turn at the heavier miseries of the Plebeians, whilst
neither of them endeavoured to put a period to
their common calamities. After the Romans had
groaned five and twenty years under this cruel and
ignominious bondage, the rape committed by Sextus,
the eldest son of Tarquin, upon Lucretia, the wife
of Collatinus, an eminent Patrician, and near relation
of the Tarquin family, produced a coalition of both
orders, which ended in the expulsion of Tarquin and
his sons, and a solemn abjuration of monarchical
government.</p>

<p>The tyranny of Tarquin had made the very name
of king so odious to the Romans in general, that the
Patricians, who were the chief conductors of this
revolution, found it no difficult matter to establish
an aristocracy upon the ruins of monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> Two
magistrates were appointed, termed consuls, vested
with the regal power, whose office was annual and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
elective. The senate was filled up out of the most
eminent of the Plebeians, after they had first been
created Patricians, and the people restored to their
right of holding assemblies, of giving their votes and
doing whatever they were entitled to by former
customs. But the power of the people was rather
nominal than real. For though the consuls were
annually elected by the suffrages of the people, a
privilege which carried the appearance of a democracy,
yet as the votes were taken by centuries, not
by tribes, the Patricians were generally masters of
the election. It is remarkable that, after the expulsion
of Tarquin, Dionysius constantly terms the new
government an aristocracy. It evidently appears too
through the whole remaining part of his history,
that there was a selfish and haughty faction amongst
the Patricians, who affected a tyrannical oligarchy,
and aimed at reducing the Plebeians to a state of servitude.
Valerius, surnamed Poplicola, the most
humane patriot of all those who were concerned in
banishing the Tarquins, introduced some beneficent
laws, which, according to Dionysius, gave great
relief to the Plebeians. For by one he made it
capital for any person to exercise any magistracy
over the Romans, unless that office should be received
from the people: as he ordered by another,
that no Roman should be punished without a legal
trial; and that if any Roman should be condemned
by any magistrate to be fined, whipped, or put to
death, the condemned person might appeal from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
sentence of that magistrate to the people, and should
be liable to no punishment until his fate had been
determined by their suffrages. A plain proof that
the Plebeians until that time laboured under grievances
not very consistent with their pretended
liberty. Another proof may be drawn from the
wretched state of the Plebeians, under the cruel
oppressions arising from the avarice and extortions
of the Patricians, which first gave birth to those
perpetual seditions, which fill the history of that
republick. For as the Roman soldiers, who were all
free citizens, not only paid their proportion of the
taxes, but were obliged to serve in the field at their
own expense during the whole campaign, this frequently
obliged them to borrow money at high
interest of the Patricians, who had engrossed by far
the greater part of publick wealth. But as the
Roman territories were often ravaged by their neighbours
in those wars, which Tarquin perpetually
incited to procure the recovery of his crown, the loss
fell heaviest upon the Plebeians, who were frequently
stript of all their effects, and reduced to the utmost
poverty. Hence unable to pay the principal of their
debts, joined to an accumulated load of usury upon
usury, they were surrendered by the judges to
the discretion of their creditors. These unfeeling
wretches confined their debtors in chains, tortured
their bodies with whips, and treated them with such
inhumanity, that great numbers of the Romans were
in as bad a situation as the poor Athenians when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Solon first undertook the administration. The effects
of this detestable treatment of people, who had been
taught to call themselves free, appeared about twelve
years after the erection of their new government.
For when the Tarquins had raised up a confederacy
of thirty cities of the Latins against them, the Plebeians
peremptorily refused to enlist until a vote
was passed for the abolition of their debts. As persuasions
had no effect, the senate met upon the
occasion. Valerius, the son of the humane Poplicola,
pleaded strongly in favour of the people, but was
violently opposed by Appius Claudius, a haughty and
imperious man, who is termed by Dionysius an
abettor of the oligarchy, and head of that faction,
which were enemies to the people. The moderate
men amongst the senators proposed, that the debts
should be paid out of the publick treasury; a measure
which would preserve the poor for the service
of the state, and prevent any injustice to the creditors.
Salutary as this measure must seem, the
opposition was so great that nothing was agreed to,
and the result of the debates was, &#8220;that no decree
should be made at present relating to this affair, but
that as soon as the war should be concluded with
success, the consuls should lay it before the senate,
and take their vote upon the occasion. That in the
mean time no debt should be sued for, and that the
execution of all laws, except those relating to the
war, should be suspended.&#8221; This decree did not
wholly quiet the ferment amongst the people. Several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
of the poorer sort demanded an immediate abolition
of their debts, as the condition for their taking a
share in the dangers of the war, and looked upon
this delay rather as an imposition. The senate,
who, as the event showed, were determined never
to grant their request, and yet were afraid of new
commotions, resolved to abolish the consulship,
and all other magistracies for the present, and to
invest a new magistrate with absolute and unlimited
power, and subject to no account for his actions.
This new officer was termed the dictator, and the
duration of his office was limited to six months,
at the end of which term the consuls were to
resume their former authority. The chief reason,
as Dionysius informs us, which induced the senate
to make use of this dangerous expedient, was to
evade that law which Poplicola had procured in
favour of the Plebeians, which made it death for a
magistrate to punish a Roman without a legal trial,
or before he was condemned by the people.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> The
senate then made a decree for the election of a
dictator, and the Plebeians ignorant, as Dionysius
observes, of the importance of that decree, not only
confirmed the resolutions of the senate, but gave up
to them the power of choosing the person who
should be invested with that dignity. Titus Lartius,
one of the consuls, was nominated by his colleague
according to the form at that time agreed upon in
the senate. When the dictator appeared in all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
pomp and grandeur of his new office, he struck a
terror into the most turbulent, and the people, thus
tricked out of that law which was their only protection,
immediately submitted. Lartius, who seems to
have been one of the greatest men of his time,
ordered in a general register of all the Romans, and
formed his army after that wise method first instituted
by Servius Tullius. When he took the field
he persuaded the Latins, by his singular address, to
disband their forces and conclude a truce, and thus
diverted the impending storm without fighting. He
then returned home, and resigned his office before
the time was expired, without having exercised any
one act of severity upon a single Roman. A noble
instance of moderation and publick virtue!</p>

<p>At the expiration of the truce, which was made
for one year only, the Latins took the field with a
powerful army. Aulus Posthumius was created dictator
by the Romans, and a decisive battle was
fought near the lake Regillus, in which the Romans
were completely victors. Sextus Tarquin was killed
upon the spot, and old Tarquin the father died
soon after. As soon as this war was ended, the
senate, regardless of their promise, ordered all those
suits for debt to be determined according to law,
which had been suspended during the war. This
faithless proceeding raised such violent commotions
amongst the people, that a foreign war was judged
the best expedient to divert the storm which threatened
the aristocracy. The haughty Appius Claudius,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
and Publius Servilius, a man of a very different
character, were nominated consuls by Posthumius
and his colleague, which seems a manifest invasion
of the rights of the people.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> A war was resolved
upon against the Volscians, but the Plebeians again
refused to obey the summons for enlisting. Servilius
adhered to the maxims of Valerius, and advised an
immediate decree for the abolition of the debts.
But he was furiously opposed by the inexorable
Appius,<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> who called him a flatterer of the people,
and declared that it would be giving up the government
to the people when they had it in their
power to live under an aristocracy. After much
time was spent in these debates, Servilius, who was
a popular man, prevailed upon the Plebeians, by his
entreaties, and raised an army of volunteers, with
which he marched against the enemy. The Volscians,
who placed their chief dependance upon the
disunion which prevailed amongst the Romans, submitted
to whatever terms the consul should think
proper to impose, and delivered three hundred hostages
chosen out of their principal families, as a
security for their behaviour. But this submission
was far from real, and was calculated only to amuse
the Romans and gain time for their military preparations.
War was once more decreed against the
Volscians; but whilst the senate was deliberating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
about the number of the forces proper to be employed,
a man advanced in years appeared in the
forum and implored the assistance of the people.
Famine sat pictured in his pale and meagre face,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>
and the squalid hue of his dress indicated the extremes
of poverty and wretchedness. This man,
who was not unknown to the people, and, according
to report, had borne a command in the army, first
showed several honourable scars in his breast, remains
of the wounds he had received in the service
of his country, and then informed them: &#8220;that he
had been present in eight and twenty battles, and
frequently received rewards bestowed only upon
superior bravery: that in the Sabine war his cattle
were driven off by the enemy, his estate plundered,
and his house reduced to ashes: that under these
unhappy circumstances he was compelled to borrow
money to pay the publick taxes; that this
debt, accumulated by usury, reduced him to the
sad necessity of selling the estate descended to him
from his ancestors, with what little effects he had
remaining: but that all this proving insufficient,
his devouring debts, like a wasting consumption,
had attacked his person, and he, with his two sons,
were delivered up as slaves, and led away to the
slaughterhouse by his creditors.&#8221; When he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
said this, he threw off his rags, and showed his back
yet bleeding from the scourge of his merciless master.
This sight inflamed the people greatly, but the
debtors breaking out of their creditor&#8217;s houses, most
of whom were loaded with chains and fetters, raised
their fury even to madness. If any one desired them
to take up arms in defence of their country, the
debtors showed their chains,<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> as the reward they had
met with for their past services, and asked with indignation,
whether such blessings were worth fighting
for. Whilst numbers of them openly declared
that it was much more eligible to be slaves to the
Volscians than the Patricians. The senate, quite disconcerted
by the violence of the tumult, entreated
Servilius to take the management of the people.
For an express was just arrived from the Latins,
with advice that a numerous army of the enemy had
already entered their territories. Servilius remonstrated
to the people the consequences of disunion
at so critical a juncture, and pacified them by the
assurance that the senate would confirm whatever
concessions he should make; he then ordered the
crier to proclaim that no citizen who voluntarily
enlisted should be subject to the demands or insults
of his creditors whilst the army continued in the
field. The people now flocked in with cheerfulness,
and the levies were soon completed. Servilius took
the field and defeated the Volscians, made himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
master of their camp, took several of their cities,
and divided the whole plunder amongst his soldiers.
At the news of this success the sanguinary Appius
ordered all the Volscian hostages to be brought into
the forum,<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> there to be whipped and publickly beheaded.
And when at his return Servilius demanded
a triumph, he loudly opposed it, called him a factious
man, and accused him of defrauding the treasury
of the booty, and prevailed upon the senate to
deny him that honour. Servilius, enraged at this
usage, entered the city in triumph with his army,
amidst the acclamations of the people, to the great
mortification of the Patricians.</p>

<p>Under the following consulship the Sabines prepared
to invade the Romans, and the people again
refused to serve unless the debts were first abolished.
Lartius, the first dictator, pleaded strongly for the
people, but the inflexible Appius proposed the
nomination of a dictator, as the only remedy against
the mutiny. His motion was carried in the senate
by a majority of voices, and Manius Valerius, a
brother to the great Poplicola, was created dictator.
Valerius, who was a man of great honour, engaged
his word to the Plebeians, that if they would serve
cheerfully upon this occasion, he would undertake
the senate should reward them by quieting the contests
relating to their debts, and granting whatever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
they could reasonably desire, and commanded at the
same time that no citizen should be sued for debt
during his administration. The people had so often
experienced the publick virtue of the Valerian
family, and no longer apprehensive of being again
imposed upon, offered themselves in such crowds,
that ten legions of four thousand men each were
levied, the greatest army of natives the Romans
had ever brought into the field. The dictator finished
the campaign with glory, was rewarded with a
triumph, and discharged the people from farther
service. This step was not at all agreeable to the
senate,<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> who feared the people would now claim the
performance of the dictator&#8217;s promises. Their fears
were just; for Valerius kept his word with the
people, and moved the senate that the promise they
had made to him might be taken into consideration.
But the Appian faction opposed it with the utmost
virulence, and exclaimed against his family as flatterers
of the people, and introducers of pernicious
laws. Valerius, finding his motion over-ruled, reproached
the senate for their behaviour, and foretold
the consequences which would attend it; and
quitting the senate abruptly called assembly of
the people. After he had thanked them for their
fidelity and bravery, he informed them of the usage
he had met with in the senate, and declared how
greatly both he and they had been imposed upon,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
and resigning his office, submitted himself to whatever
treatment the people should think proper.
The people heard him with equal veneration and
compassion, and attended him home from the forum
with repeated acclamations. The Plebeians now
kept no measures with the senate, but assembled
openly, and consulted about seceding from the
Patricians. To prevent this step, the senate ordered
the consuls not to dismiss their armies, but
to lead them out into the field, under pretence that
the Sabines were again preparing for an invasion.
The consuls left the city and encamped nearly together;
but the soldiers, instigated by one Sicinnius
Bellutus, seized the arms and ensigns to avoid
violating their military oath, seceded from the
consuls, and after they had appointed Sicinnius
commander in chief, encamped on a certain eminence
near the river Anio, which from that event
was always termed the <i>mons sacer</i>, or the holy
mountain.</p>

<p>When the news of this secession was brought to
Rome, the confusion was so great, that the city had
the appearance of a place taken by storm, and the
Appian faction were severely reproached as the
cause of this desertion. Their enemies at the same
time making inroads up to the very gates of Rome,
increased the general consternation, as the Patricians
were terribly afraid they would be joined by
the seceders. But the soldiers behaved with so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
much decency and moderation, that the senate after
long debates sent deputies to invite them to return,
with the promise of a general amnesty. The offer
was received with scorn, and the Patricians were
charged with dissimulation, in pretending ignorance
of the just demands of the Plebeians, and the true
cause of their secession. At the return of the deputies,
the affair was again debated in the senate.
Agrippa Menenius, a man respectable for his superior
wisdom and thorough knowledge of the true
principles of government, and who was alike an
enemy to tyranny in the aristocracy, and licentiousness
in the people, advised healing measures,
and proposed to send such persons as the people
could confide in with full power to put an end to the
sedition in the manner they should judge most proper,
without farther application to the senate. Manius
Valerius, the last dictator, spoke next, and reminded
the senate, &#8220;that his predictions of the evils which
would result from their breach of promise were now
verified, that he advised a speedy accommodation
with the people, lest the same evils, if suffered to
make a farther progress, should become incurable:
that in his opinion the demands of the people would
rise higher than the bare abolition of debts, and that
they would insist upon such security as might be
the firm guardian of their rights and liberty for the
future. Because the late institution of the dictatorship
had superseded the Valerian law which was
before the only guardian of their liberty, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
late denial of a triumph to the consul Servilius, who
had deserved that honour more than any man in
Rome, evidently proved, that the people were deprived
of almost all those privileges they had formerly
enjoyed, since a consul and a dictator who
showed the least concern for the interests of the
people, were treated with abuse and ignominy by
the senate: that he did not impute these arbitrary
measures to the most considerable and respectable
persons amongst the Patricians, but to a combination
of proud and avaricious men wholly intent
upon unwarrantable gain; who by advancing large
sums at excessive interest, had enslaved many of
their fellow-citizens, and by their cruel and insulting
treatment of their unhappy debtors, had alienated
the whole body of the Plebeians from the aristocracy:
that these men, by forming themselves into
a faction, and placing Appius, a known enemy to
the people and abettor of the oligarchy, at their
head, had under his patronage, reduced the commonwealth
to its present desperate situation.&#8221; He
concluded by seconding the motion of Menenius for
sending ambassadours to put a speedy end to the
sedition upon the best terms they should be able to
obtain.</p>

<p>Appius, finding himself thus personally attacked,
rose up and replied to Valerius in a hot inflammatory
speech full of the most virulent invectives.
He denied that he was ever guilty of enslaving his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
debtors: &#8220;he denied too, that those who had acted in
that manner could be charged with injustice, since
they had done no more than the laws allowed. He
affirmed that the imputation of being an enemy to
the people, and favouring oligarchy, arose from his
steady adherence to the aristocracy, and equally
affected all those of superior worth, who like him
disdained to be governed by their inferiors, or to
suffer the form of government which they had inherited
from their ancestors<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> to deviate into the worst
of all constitutions, a democracy. He recriminated
upon Valerius, and charged him with aiming at
tyranny, by courting the most profligate of the citizens,
as the most effectual and shortest way of
enslaving his country. He termed the seceders, vile,
mean wretches, a thoughtless senseless multitude,
whose present arrogance had been first inspired by
that old man, as he contemptuously called Valerius.
He declared absolutely against sending ambassadours,
or making the least concession, and advised rather
to arm the slaves and send for assistance from their
allies the Latins, than submit to any thing that
might derogate from the power and dignity of the
Patricians. He proposed, if the seceders should
appear in arms against them, to put their wives and
children to death before their faces by the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
severe and ignominious tortures. But if they would
submit at discretion to the senate, he advised to
treat them with moderation.&#8221; This speech produced
a violent tumult in the senate, and the young
Patricians who adhered to Appius behaved with
so much insolence, that the consuls threatened to
exclude them from the publick counsels, by a law
which should fix the age for the qualification of every
senator. Nothing was determined at that time, but
in a few days, the moderate party, supported by
the firmness of the consuls, prevailed against the
still inflexible Appius, and ten ambassadours, at the
head of whom were Menenius and Valerius, were
sent with full powers to treat with the seceders.
After many debates, Menenius in the name of the
senate promised full redress of all their grievances
with respect to the debts, and offered to confirm
this promise by the solemn oaths of all the ambassadours.
His offer was upon the point of being
accepted, when Lucius Junius, who affected the
surname of Brutus, a bold and able Plebeian, interposed
and insisted upon such a security from the
senate as might protect the Plebeians for the future
from the power of their enemies, who might find an
opportunity of wreaking their vengeance on the
people for the step they had taken. When Menenius
desired to know what security he required,
Junius demanded leave for the people to choose
annually a certain number of magistrates out of
their own body, vested with the power of defending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
their rights and liberties, and protecting their persons
from injury and violence. As this new and
unexpected demand seemed of too great consequence
to be granted by the ambassadours, Valerius
with some others were sent to take the opinion of
the senate upon that subject. Valerius laid this
demand before the senate, and gave his opinion that
the favour should be granted, and Appius, as usual,
opposed it with outrageous fury. But the majority,
determined at all events to put a period to the
secession, ratified all the promises made by the
ambassadours, and granted the desired security. The
seceders held their assembly in the camp, and taking
the votes by curi&aelig;, elected five persons for their
annual magistrates, who were termed tribunes of
the people. By a law made immediately after the
election, the persons of the tribunes were rendered
sacred; and the people obliged themselves to swear
by whatever was held most sacred that they and
their posterity would preserve it inviolably.</p>

<p>The erection of the tribunitial-power, which happened
about seventeen years after the expulsion of
the kings, is certainly the &aelig;ra from which the liberty
of the Roman people ought properly to be dated.
All the neighbouring states were at that time subject
to aristocracy, where the people had little or no
share in the government, and it appears evidently
from the Roman historians that the Romans intended
to establish the same form of government at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Rome after the abolition of monarchy. For the
senate, as Livy informs us,<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> gave a loose to that
unbounded joy which the death of Tarquin inspired,
and begun to oppress and injure the people, whom
until that time they had courted with the utmost
assiduity. But Sallust is more full and explicit.
For he affirms,<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> &#8220;that after the expulsion of the
kings, as long as the fear of Tarquin and the burdensome
war with the Etrurians kept the Romans
in suspense, the government was administered with
equity and moderation. But as soon as ever the
dread of those impending dangers was removed, the
senate begun to domineer over the people and treat
them as slaves; inflicting death or scourging after
the arbitrary manner of despotick tyrants; expelling
them from their lands, and arrogating the whole
power of government to themselves, without communicating
the least share of it to the Plebeians.&#8221;
Thus the people, before the creation of this magistracy,
were amused with the name of liberty, whilst
in fact they had only changed the tyranny of one,
for the more galling yoke of three hundred. But
the tribunicial-power proved an invincible obstacle
to the arbitrary schemes of the aristocratick faction,
and at last introduced that due admixture of democracy,
which is so essentially necessary to the constitution
of a well regulated republick.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>As a minute detail of a history so well known as
that of the Romans would be quite superfluous, I
shall only observe, that the democratick power in
that republick did not arrive at its just state of
independence, until the Plebeians were not only
entitled to the highest posts and dignities, equally
with the Patricians, but until the plebiscita or decrees
made by the people in their assembly by tribes,<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a>
were confirmed to be equally binding as those made
in their assembly by centuries. This law was first
made when the tyranny of the decemvirs was
abolished by the second secession of the people to
the Sacred Mountain, but was perpetually violated
by the over-bearing power of the aristocracy. But
an event similar to that which occasioned the first
secession of the people, to which they properly owed
the origin of their liberty, was the cause of the third
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
and last secession, which fully completed that liberty,
and gave the fatal blow to the arbitrary aristocratick
faction. Veturius, the son of Titus Veturius, who
had been consul and died insolvent, borrowed a sum
of money of one Plotius to defray the expenses of
his father&#8217;s funeral. As the father was greatly
indebted to the same Plotius, he demanded of young
Veturius the payment of both debts which his father
and he himself had contracted. As the unhappy
young man was utterly unable to satisfy the demand,
Plotius seized his unfortunate debtor, and confined
him to the work of a slave, until he had discharged
both principal and interest. Veturius bore his servitude
with patience, and did his utmost to please
his creditor. But as he refused to gratify the detestable
passion of the infamous Plotius he treated him
with the utmost inhumanity to force him to a compliance.
One day he had the good fortune to escape
out of the house of his merciless creditor, and fled to
the forum, where he showed his back torn with
stripes and his body covered with blood, and explained
the reason of his shocking treatment. The
people, enraged at so dreadful a spectacle, demanded
an absolute security against that law, which gave the
creditors such a shameful power over their insolvent
debtors. For though that law had been abolished
near forty years before upon a like occasion, yet the
Patricians, by their superior power, had again revived
it. The consuls reported the affair to the
senate, who committed Plotius to prison, and ordered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
all those who were in custody for debt to be set at
liberty. The Plebeians, not satisfied with these
trifling concessions, insisted upon the absolute abolition
of that inhuman law; but they were opposed
with equal animosity by the Patricians. Despairing
therefore of gaining their point by entreaties and
remonstrances, they retired in a body to the Janiculum,
resolutely determined never to enter the city,
until they had received full satisfaction. The senate,
alarmed at this secession, had recourse to their last
resource in all desperate cases, the creation of a
dictator. Q. Hortensius was nominated dictator
upon this occasion, a man of great temper and prudence,
and a real friend to liberty. As he was
vested with absolute power by virtue of his office, he
totally abolished that law which had given such just
cause of uneasiness, and notwithstanding all the
opposition of the senate, revived and confirmed two
laws which had been formerly made, though constantly
violated by the Patricians. One was, &#8220;that
the decrees made by the Plebeians should be equally
obligatory to the Patricians:&#8221; the other, &#8220;that all
laws passed in the senate should be laid before the
comitia, or assemblies of the people, either to be
confirmed or rejected.&#8221; Thus the liberty, which
the Plebeians had acquired by the first secession,
was confirmed in the plainest and strongest manner
by the last, which happened about two hundred
and six years after. For the Patricians, from that
memorable &aelig;ra, had scarce any other advantage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
over the Plebeians, except what arose from their
superior wealth, and that respect which is naturally
paid by inferiors to men of superior birth.</p>

<p>It is evident, from that sudden change which the
Plebeians experienced in the behaviour of the Patricians
at the death of Tarquin, that if the senate
could have supported themselves in that arbitrary
power, which they so visibly aimed at, the condition
of the people would have been just like that of the
Polish peasants under their imperious lords. For in
that detestable aristocracy, the Patricians, not content
with the wealth of the republick, which centered
chiefly in their own body, used their utmost efforts
to engross the entire possession of the lands. The
secession of the people, and the creation of the
tribunes, defeated the scheme they had formed for
establishing an aristocratick tyranny. But the frequent
attempts to revive the Agrarian law prove undeniably
that the Patricians never lost sight of their ambitious
views of aggrandizing their families by an illegal
usurpation of the conquered lands. Spurius Cassius,
a Patrician, was the first author of this law, about
eight years after the secession, with a view of raising
himself to the regal power by conciliating the affection
and interest of the people. The law itself was
certainly just, and founded upon that equality in the
distribution of the land, which was a part of the
constitution, as settled by their founder Romulus.
The plea therefore of Cassius, &#8220;that the lands,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
which had been conquered by the blood and valour
of the people, should be taken from the rich and
applied to the service of the publick,&#8221; was founded
upon the strictest equity, as well as the fundamental
principles of their constitution. Even Appius, the
most inveterate enemy to the people, acknowledged
the justice of his proposal, since he moved that commissioners
should be appointed by the senate to fix
the boundaries of the land in question, and sell, or
let it out in farms for the benefit of the publick.
This advice was unanimously approved of, and the
senate passed a decree, that ten of the most ancient
consular senators should be appointed commissioners
to carry this scheme into execution. This decree
at once pacified the people and ruined Cassius. For
as he had proposed to divide two thirds of the lands
between the Latins and Hernici, whose assistance
he at that time courted, the people gave him up to
the resentment of the senate, who condemned him
for plotting to introduce a single tyranny, and ordered
him to be thrown down the Tarpeian precipice.</p>

<p>This was the first rise of the famous agrarian law,
which occasioned such frequent contests between the
senate and the people, and stirred up the first civil
war in Rome, which ended in the murder of both
the Gracchi, about three hundred and fifty years
after. For the senate not only evaded the nomination
of the commissioners, as they had promised in their
decree, but, whenever that affair was brought upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
the carpet, they acted with an insincerity and artifice
which are highly inconsistent with the so much
vaunted probity of the Roman senate. Unless therefore
we attend to the true reasons, upon which the
agrarian law was originally founded, we can never
form a right judgment of the perpetual dissensions
between the senate and the tribunes upon that
subject. For though the chief blame, in all these
contests, is most commonly thrown upon the turbulent
and seditious temper of the tribunes, yet, if the
real cause of those dissensions is impartially examined,
we shall find that most of them took rise
from the avarice and injustice of the Patricians. But
though the tribunitial power was sometimes made
subservient to the interested views of some ambitious
tribunes, yet no argument can justly be drawn from
the abuse of that power against its real utility. For
how much it was dreaded as the bulwark of the
liberty of the people, is evident from this consideration:
that it was reduced almost to nothing by Sylla,
and afterwards totally absorbed by Augustus and the
succeeding emperors, who never looked upon the
people as thoroughly enslaved until they had annexed
the tribunitial power to the imperatorial dignity.</p>

<p>I remarked before, that when the highest dignities
and employments in the republick were laid open to
the Plebeians, and the decrees of the people had the
same force, and affected the Patricians in the same
manner as those which were issued by the senate,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
the democratick power was raised to an equality with
the aristocratick. But as a third power, or estate
(as we term it) was wanting, capable of preserving
the requisite &aelig;quilibrium between the other two, it
was impossible from the very nature of the republican
constitution, that the equality between the two
powers could be long supported. The concessions
made by Hortensius quieted indeed the civil dissensions;
and it is remarkable too, that after peace was
restored to the republick, the progress of the Roman
conquests was so amazingly rapid, that in little more
than two hundred years from that period they had
subjugated the most opulent empires in the universe.
But the same conquests, which raised the republick
to the summit of her grandeur, threw too much
weight into the democratick scale, and, by totally
corrupting the Roman manners, brought on the final
ruin of their liberty and constitution. For as every
conquered province created successively a new government,
these new dignities immediately became
new objects of avarice and ambition. But as the
command of the armies, the government of provinces,
and the highest posts in the state, were
disposed of by the suffrages of the people; the candidates
for those lucrative employments left no means
unattempted to secure a majority. Hence, as the
poor Plebeians were extremely numerous, the man
who was able to distribute the greatest largesses, or
divert the mob with the finest shows, was generally
the most successful. When the interest of the candidates
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
was nearly equal, force was frequently made
use of to decide the contest; and it was not uncommon
to see the forum<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> covered with the slaughtered
bodies of the electors. The generals who were
elected fleeced the provinces to enable themselves
to keep up their interest at home with the people,
and connived at the rapines of their soldiers to secure
their affections. Hence at Rome liberty degenerated
into the most outrageous licentiousness, whilst the
soldiers gradually wore off that parental love for
their country, which was once the characteristick of
the Romans, and attached themselves wholly to the
fortunes of their generals. Hence the most succesful
leaders began to look upon themselves no longer
as servants, but as masters of the republick, and
each endeavoured to support his pretensions by force
of arms. The faction of Sylla and Marius filled the
city alternately with slaughter and rapine, as the
fortune of their respective leaders prevailed in the
course of that destructive contest. And Rome frequently
felt the calamitous effects of war in her own
bowels, at a time when her victorious arms abroad
were adding new provinces to her dominions. These
factions were far from expiring with their leaders,
but broke out again with the same baleful fury under
the first and second triumvirate. Each of these,
strictly speaking, were no more than coalitions of
the same factions, where three chiefs united their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
several parties to crush every other. When they
had accomplished this, and satiated their ambition,
their avarice, and their private resentments, by the
most bloody proscriptions, they quarrelled about the
division of power, like captains of banditti about the
division of booty, with whom they agreed in principle,
and differed only in degree. These quarrels
occasioned those civil wars, which gave the finishing
blow to the Roman republick. The ablest and most
dangerous man, in each triumvirate, proved at last
the conqueror; and Julius C&aelig;sar first put those
chains upon his country, which Augustus riveted
beyond a possibility of removal.</p>

<p>All the historians, from whom we have received
any account of the Roman affairs, agree unanimously
in fixing their conquest of Antiochus the Great, as
the &aelig;ra from whence we are to date the rise of
luxury and corruption amongst them. Livy assures
us, that luxury was first introduced into their city by
the army of Manlius at their return from Asia.
They, he informs us, were the first who made Rome
acquainted with the finely ornamented couches, the
rich carpets, the embroidered hangings, and other
expensive productions of the looms of Asia, with all
those elegant tables of various forms and workmanship,
which were esteemed so essential a part of
that magnificence which they affected in their furniture.
They introduced wenches, who sung and
played upon different instruments, with dancers of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
anticks, to heighten the mirth and indulgence of the
table. To show to what height they carried the
expense and luxury of the table, he adds, with
indignation, that a cook, who, by their frugal and
temperate ancestors, was looked upon, from his
very office, as the vilest slave in the household, was
now esteemed an officer of mighty consequence, and
cookery was erected into an art, which before was
looked upon as the most servile kind of drudgery.
Yet new and strange as these first specimens might
seem, Livy assures us, that they were but trifles
when compared to their succeeding luxury. Before
that fatal &aelig;ra the Romans were poor, but they
were contented and happy, because they knew no
imaginary wants: and whilst their manners were
virtuous, poverty itself was honourable, and added a
new lustre to every other virtue. But when once
they had contracted a relish for the luxury of Asia,
they quickly found that the wealth of Asia was
necessary to support it; and this discovery as quickly
produced a total change in their manners. Before
that time the love of glory, and a contempt of
wealth, was the ruling passion of the Romans.
Since that time money was the only object of their
applause and desire. Before, ambition impelled
them to war, from a thirst of dominion; now avarice,
for the sake of plunder to support the expense of
luxury. Before, they seemed a race of heroes; they
were now a gang of insatiable robbers. Formerly,
when they had reduced a people to obedience, they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
received them as their allies; they now made the
conquered nations their slaves. They fleeced the
provinces, and oppressed their friends. As the great
offices, which entitled the possessors to the command
of armies, and the government of provinces,
were disposed of by the votes of the people, no
method was left unattempted to secure a majority
of suffrages. The candidates for these employments,
not only exhausted their own fortunes, but strained
their credit to the utmost, to bribe the people with
shows and donatives. To this infamous period we
must fix the rise of that torrent of corruption, which
so quickly deluged the Roman republick. The
successful candidates set out for their government,
like hungry emaciated wolves, to fatten upon the
blood of the miserable provinces. Cicero makes
heavy complaints of the rapine and extortion of
these rapacious oppressors; and his orations against
Verres, when accused by the Sicilians, give us a
complete idea of the behaviour of a Roman governour
in his province. The complaints of the oppressed
provincials were incessant; but every governour had
his friends amongst the leading men, whom he
secured by a share of the plunder, and the weight of
their whole interest was applied to screen the
criminal. Laws indeed were made against this crime
of peculation, but they were easily eluded, because
the judges, who were chosen out of the body of the
people, were as corrupt as the offenders, and were
frequently their associates in villany. Thus corruption
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
made its way into the very vitals of the republick.
Every thing was venal, and the venality had
made so rapid a progress, even in the time of
Jugurtha, which was about eighty years after the
defeat of Antiochus, as to occasion the severe sarcasm
of that prince, recorded by Sallust, which places
the corruption of the Romans in a stronger point of
view, than the most laboured and pathetick description
of their historians. &#8220;That Rome had carried
her venality to so great a height, as to be ready to
sell herself to destruction, if she could but find a
purchaser.&#8221; When the Romans had beggared the
monarchs, whom they vouchsafed to style their
friends, and drained the provinces until they had
scarce any thing left to plunder; the same principle
which had induced them to pillage the universe,
impelled them now to prey upon one another.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>
Marius and Sylla were the first Romans who set
the fatal precedent, and were the first who bridled
Rome with a standing army. The civil power was
compelled to give way to the military, and from that
period we may truly date the ruin of the Roman
liberty. The state continued to fluctuate between
despotism and anarchy, until it terminated irretrievably
under the C&aelig;sars, in the most absolute, and
most infernal tyranny that any people were ever yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
cursed with. Marius opened the bloody scene, and
glutted his followers with the blood and wealth of
the friends of Sylla. Sylla repaid the Marian faction
in the same coin with usury. Battles were fought
in the very streets; and Rome, more than once,
experienced all the horrors of a city taken by storm
from her own citizens. Personal resentment and
revenge for injuries received, were the pretence on
both sides, but plunder and confiscations seem to
have been the chief motives. For the rich were
equally looked upon as enemies, and equally proscribed
by both factions, and they alone were safe
who had nothing worth taking.</p>

<p>If we connect the various strokes, interspersed
through what we have remaining of the writings of
Sallust, which he levelled at the vices of his countrymen,
we shall be able to form a just idea of the
manners of the Romans in the time of that historian.
From the picture, thus faithfully exhibited, we
must be convinced, that not only those shocking
calamities, which the republick suffered during the
contest between Marius and Sylla, but those subsequent,
and more fatal evils, which brought on the
utter extinction of the Roman liberty and constitution,
were the natural effects of that foreign luxury,
which first introduced venality and corruption.
Though the introduction of luxury from Asia preceded
the ruin of Carthage in point of time, yet, as
Sallust informs us, the dread of that dangerous rival
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
restrained the Romans within the bounds of decency
and order.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> But as soon as ever that obstacle was
removed,<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> they gave a full scope to their ungoverned
passions. The change in their manners was not
gradual, and by little and little, as before, but rapid
and instantaneous. Religion, justice, modesty, decency,
all regard for divine or human laws, were
swept away at once by the irresistible torrent of
corruption. The nobility strained the privileges
annexed to their dignity,<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> and the people their
liberty, alike into the most unbounded licentiousness.
Every one made the dictates of his own lawless
will his only rule of action. Publick virtue, and the
love of their country, which had raised the Romans
to the empire of the universe, were extinct. Money,<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a>
which alone could enable them to gratify their darling
luxury, was substituted in their place. Power,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
which alone could enable them to gratify their darling
dominion, honours, and universal respect, were
annexed to the possession of money. Contempt,
and whatever was most reproachful, was the bitter
portion of poverty; and to be poor, grew to be the
greatest of all crimes in the estimation of the Romans.
Thus wealth and poverty contributed alike to the
ruin of the republick. The rich employed their
wealth in the acquisition of power,<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> and their power
in every kind of oppression and rapine, for the
acquisition of more wealth. The poor,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> now dissolute
and desperate, were ready to engage in every
seditious insurrection, which promised them the
plunder of the rich, and set up both their liberty
and their country to sale to the best bidder. The
republick,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> which was the common prey to both, was
thus rent to pieces between the contending parties.
As an universal selfishness is the genuine effect of
universal luxury, so the natural effect of selfishness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
is to break through every tie, both divine and
human, and to stick at no kind of excesses in the
pursuit of wealth, its favourite object. Thus the
effects of selfishness will naturally appear in irreligion,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>
breach of faith, perjury, a contempt of all
the social duties, extortion, frauds in our dealings,
pride, cruelty, universal venality and corruption.
From selfishness arises that vicious ambition (if I
may be allowed the term) which Sallust rightly
defines, &#8220;the lust of domination.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> Ambition as a
passion, precedes avarice; for the seeds of ambition
seem almost to be innate. The desire of pre-eminence,
the fondness for being distinguished above the rest
of our fellow-creatures, attends us from the cradle
to the grave. Though as it takes its complexion,
so it receives its denomination from the different
objects it pursues, which in all are but the different
means of attaining the same end. But the lust of
domination, here mentioned by Sallust, though generally
confounded with ambition, is in reality a different
passion, and is, strictly speaking, only a different
mode of selfishness. For the chief end which
we propose, by the lust of domination, is to draw
every thing to centre in ourselves, which we think
will enable us to gratify every other passion. I confess
it may be alleged, that self-love and selfishness
both arise from the general law of self-preservation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
and are but different modes of the same principle.
I acknowledge, that if we examine strictly all those
heroick instances of love, friendship, or patriotism,
which seem to be carried to the most exalted degree
of disinterestedness, we shall probably find the principle
of self-love lurking at the bottom of many of
them. But, if we rightly define these two principles,
we shall find an essential difference between
our ideas of self-love, and selfishness. Self-love,
within its due bounds, is the practice of the great
duty of self-preservation, regulated by that law
which the great author of our being has given for
that very end. Self-love therefore is not only compatible
with the most rigid practice of the social
duties, but is in fact a great motive and incentive to
the practice of all moral virtue. Whereas selfishness,
by reducing every thing to the single point
of private interest, a point which it never loses sight
of, banishes all the social virtues, and is the first
spring of action, which impels to all those disorders,
which are so fatal to mixed government in particular,
and to society in general. From this poisonous
source Sallust deduces all those evils,<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> which
spread the pestilence of corruption over the whole
face of the republick, and changed the mildest and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
most upright government in the universe into the
most inhuman, and most insupportable tyranny. For
as the lust of domination can never possibly attain
its end without the assistance of others, the man,
who is actuated by that destructive passion, must,
of necessity, strive to attach to himself a set of men
of similar principles, for the subordinate instruments.
This is the origin of all those iniquitous combinations,
which we call factions. To accomplish
this,<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> he must put on as many shapes as Proteus;
he must ever wear the mask of dissimulation, and
live a perpetual lie. He will court the friendship
of every man, who is capable of promoting, and
endeavour to crush every man, who is capable of
defeating his ambitious views. Thus his friendship
and his enmity will be alike unreal, and easily convertible,
if the change will serve his interest. As
private interest is the only tie which can ever connect
a faction,<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> the lust of wealth, which was the
cause of the lust of domination, will now become
the effect, and must be proportional to the sum total
of the demands of the whole faction; and, as the
latter know no bounds, so the former, will be alike
insatiable. For when once a man is inured to bribes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
in the service of faction,<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> he will expect to be paid
as well for acting for, as for acting against the dictates
of his conscience. A truth, which every minister
must have experienced, who has been supported
by a faction, and which a late great minister
(as he frankly confessed) found to be the case with
him during his long administration. But how deeply
soever a state may be immersed in luxury and corruption,
yet the man who aims at being the head of
a faction for the end of domination,<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> will at first
cloak his real design under an affected zeal for the
service of the government. When he has established
himself in power, and formed his party, all
who support his measures will be rewarded as the
friends; all who oppose him will be treated as
enemies to the government. The honest and uncorrupt
citizen will be hunted down as disaffected,
and all his remonstrances, against mal-administration,
will be represented as proceeding from that
principle. The cant term, <i>disaffection</i>, will be the
watch-word of the faction; and the charge of disaffection,
that constant resource of iniquitous ministers,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
that infallible sign that a cause will not stand
the test of a fair inquiry, will be perpetually employed
by the tools of power to silence those objections
which they want argument to answer. The faction
will estimate the worth of their leader,<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> not by his
services to his country, for the good of the publick
will be looked upon as obsolete and chimerical; but
his ability to gratify, or screen his friends, and crush
his opponents. The leader will fix the implicit
obedience to his will, as the test of merit to his
faction: consequently all the dignities, and lucrative
posts will be conferred upon persons of that stamp
only, whilst honesty and publick virtue will be standing
marks of political reprobation. Common justice
will be denied to the latter in all controverted
elections, whilst the laws will be strained, or over-ruled
in favour of the former. Luxury is the certain
forerunner of corruption, because it is the certain
parent of indigence: consequently a state so circumstanced
will always furnish an ample supply of
proper instruments for faction. For as luxury consists
in an inordinate gratification of the sensual
passions,<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> the more the passions are indulged they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
grow the more importunately craving, until the
greatest fortune must sink under their insatiable
demands. Thus luxury necessarily produces corruption.
For as wealth is essentially necessary to
the support of luxury, wealth will be the universal
object of desire in every state where luxury prevails:
consequently all those who have dissipated their
private fortunes in the purchase of pleasure, will be
ever ready to enlist in the cause of faction for the
wages of corruption. A taste for pleasure immoderately
indulged, quickly strengthens into habit,
eradicates every principle of honour and virtue, and
gets possession of the whole man. And the more
expensive such a man is in his pleasures, the greater
lengths he will run for the acquisition of wealth for
the end of profusion. Thus the contagion will
become so universal, that nothing but an uncommon
share of virtue can preserve the possessor from
infection. For when once the idea of respect and
homage is annexed to the possession of wealth
alone,<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> honour, probity, every virtue and every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
amiable quality will be held cheap in comparison,
and looked upon as awkward and quite unfashionable.
But as the spirit of liberty will yet exist in some
degree in a state which retains the name of freedom,
even though the manners of that state should be
generally depraved, an opposition will arise from
those virtuous citizens, who know the value of their
birthright, <i>liberty</i>, and will never submit tamely to
the chains of faction. Force then will be called in
to the aid of corruption,<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> and a standing army will be
introduced. A military government will be established
upon the ruins of the civil, and all commands
and employments will be disposed of at the arbitrary
will of lawless power. The people will be fleeced to
pay for their own fetters, and doomed, like the cattle,
to unremitting toil and drudgery for the support
of their tyrannical masters. Or, if the outward form
of civil government should be permitted to remain,
the people will be compelled to give a sanction to
tyranny by their own suffrages, and to elect oppressors
instead of protectors.</p>

<p>From this genuine portrait of the Roman manners,
it is evident to a demonstration, that the fatal catastrophe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
of that republick (of which Sallust himself
was an eye witness) was the natural effect of the
corruption of their manners. It is equally as evident
from our author, and the rest of the Roman historians,
that the corruption of their manners was the
natural effect of foreign luxury, introduced and supported
by foreign wealth. The fatal tendency of
these evils, was too obvious to escape the notice of
every sensible Roman, who had any regard for
liberty, and their ancient constitution. Many sumptuary
laws were made to restrain the various excesses
of luxury; but these efforts were too feeble
to check the over-bearing violence of the torrent.
Cato proposed a severe law, enforced by the sanction
of an oath, against bribery and corruption at elections;
where the scandalous traffick of votes was
established by custom as at a publick market. But,
as Plutarch observes,<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> he incurred the resentment
of both parties by that salutary measure. The rich
were his enemies, because they found themselves
precluded from all pretensions to the highest dignities;
as they had no other merit to plead but what
arose from their superior wealth. The electors
abused, cursed, and even pelted him as the author of
a law which deprived them of the wages of corruption,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
and reduced them to the necessity of subsisting
by labour.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> But this law, if it really passed, had as
little effect as any of the former; and like the same
laws in our own country, upon the same occasion,
was either evaded by chicane, or over-ruled by
power. Our own septennial scenes of drunkenness,
riot, bribery, and abandoned perjury, may serve to
give us an idea of the annual elections of the
Romans in those abominable times.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> Corruption
was arrived at its last stage, and the depravity was
universal. The whole body of the unhappy republick
was infected, and the distemper was utterly incurable.
For those excesses which formerly were
esteemed the vices of the people,<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> were now, by the
force of custom fixed into habit, become the manners
of the people. A most infallible criterion, by which
we may ascertain the very point of time, when the
ruin of the any free state, which labours under these
evils, may be naturally expected.</p>

<p>The conspiracies of Catiline and C&aelig;sar against the
liberty of their country, were but genuine effects
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
of that corruption, which Sallust has marked out
to us, as the immediate cause of the destruction of
the republick. The end proposed by each of these
bad men, and the means employed for that end,
were the same in both. The difference in their
success arose only from the difference of address
and abilities in the respective leaders. The followers
of Catiline, as Sallust informs us, were the
most dissolute, the most profligate, and the most
abandoned wretches, which could be culled out of
the most populous and most corrupt city of the
universe.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> C&aelig;sar, upon the same plan, formed his
party, as we learn from Plutarch out of the most
infected, and most corrupt members of the very same
state.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> The vices of the times easily furnished a
supply of proper instruments. To pilfer the publick
money,<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> and to plunder the provinces by violence,
though state-crimes of the most heinous nature,
were grown so familiar by custom, that they were
looked upon as no more than mere office-perquisites.
The younger people, who are ever most ripe for
sedition and insurrection, were so corrupted by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
luxury,<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> that they might be deservedly termed, &#8220;an
abandoned race, whose dissipation made it impracticable
for them to keep their own private fortunes;
and whose avarice would not suffer their
fellow-citizens to enjoy the quiet possession of
theirs.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not at all strange that Rome thus circumstanced
should fall a victim to the corruption of her
own citizens: nor that the empire of the universe,
the toil and labour of ages, to which the Romans
had waded through seas of blood, should be destined
to feed the detestable vices of a few monsters, who
were a disgrace even to human nature. The total
change of the Roman constitution, the unlimited
tyranny of the emperors, and the abject slavery of
the people, were all effects of the same cause, extended
in degree by a natural progression. The
Romans in fact were no more; the name indeed
subsisted, but the idea affixed to that name, was as
totally changed as their ancient constitution. In the
time of Pyrrhus the Roman senate appeared an
assembly of kings to his ambassadour Cyneas. When
the east had felt the force of the Roman arms, the
most despotick princes received the orders of a
Roman senate, and executed them with as prompt
obedience, as a slave would do the commands of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
master. A deputy from the Roman senate made a
haughty monarch tremble at the head of a victorious
army, compelled him to resign all his conquests, and
return ingloriously home, by a single motion of his
walking-stick.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>

<p>What an elevated idea must this give us of the
Roman manners, whilst that haughty people retained
their freedom! Nothing is more grand; nothing
more striking. Shift but the scene, and view the
manners of the Romans when enslaved. Nothing is
so abjectly servile, nothing so despicable. We see
the Roman senate deifying the worst of mankind;
wretches, who had sunk even below humanity, and
offering the adoration of incense to these idols of
their own making, who were more contemptible
than the very stone and wooden representatives of
their deities. Instead of giving law to monarchs,
and deciding the fate of nations, we see the august
Roman senate run trembling like slaves at the
summons of their master Domitian,<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> to debate in
form about the important business of dressing a
turbot!! The majesty of the Roman people, which
received the tributary homage of the universe, expired
together with their liberty. That people, who
disposed of the highest offices in the government,
the command of armies, provinces and kingdoms,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
were sunk into a herd of dispirited slaves. Their
total insignificancy screened them from the fatal
effects of the caprices of their tyrants. They dragged
on a wretched being in a state of idleness and
poverty in the midst of slavery, and the utmost
extent of their wishes amounted to no more, than
bread for their daily subsistence, and diversions for
their amusement.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> The emperors supplied the one
by their frequent largesses of corn, and gratified the
other by their numerous publick shows. Hence
historians observe, that the most infamous of their
tyrants were as fond of rareeshows, as the mob themselves,
and as they were by much the most profuse
of all their emperors, their deaths were always most
regretted by the people. So striking is the contrast
between a state when blessed with liberty, and the
same state when reduced to slavery by the corruption
of its people!</p>

<p>As I have already made some reflections upon
that passion for theatrical entertainments, which
prevailed at Athens, I cannot help observing, that
after the introduction of luxury, the fondness for
that kind of diversion amongst the Romans, was at
least equal to that of the Athenians. The Romans
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
seem to have been strangers to every kind of stage-plays
for the first four hundred years. Their first
attempts of that kind were rude and simple, and not
unlike the ancient mummery at our country wakes,
or Christmas gambols. The regular drama was
imported together with the luxury of Greece, but
every species of this kind of entertainment, whether
tragedy, comedy, farce, or pantomime, was comprehended
under the general denomination of stage-plays,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>
and the different performers alike ranged
under the general term of players.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> The profession
itself was reckoned scandalous, and proper only for
slaves, and if once a Roman citizen appeared upon
the stage, he immediately forfeited his right of voting,
and every other privilege of a free man. Upon this
account Cicero seems to lament the fate of his
friend Roscius, when he tells us, &#8220;that he was so
superior to all, as a player,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> that he alone seemed
worthy of appearing upon the stage: but of so
exalted a character, as a man, that of all men he
deserved least to be doomed to so scandalous a profession.&#8221;
Suetonius, speaking of the licentiousness
and insolence of the players, takes notice of an
ancient law, which empowered the pr&aelig;tors and
&oelig;diles to whip those players publickly, who gave the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
least offence, or did not perform to the satisfaction
of the people. Though Augustus<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> as the same
historian informs us, exempted players from the
ignominy of that law, yet he took care to restrain
them within the bounds of decency and good manners.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a>
For he ordered Stephanio, a celebrated comedian,
to be whipped publickly through all the theatres,
and afterwards banished him, for presuming privately
to keep a Roman matron disguised under the
habit of his boy. Upon a complaint from the pr&aelig;tor
he made Hylas the pantomime be lashed openly in
the court of his own palace, to which place the
offender had fled for refuge; and banished Pylades,
one of the most eminent players, not only from
Rome but even from Italy, for affronting one of the
audience who had hissed him upon the stage. But
these restraints seem to have expired with Augustus.
For we find the pride and insolence of the players
carried to so great a height in the reign of his successor
Tiberius, as to occasion their total banishment.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
The fondness of the populace for the entertainments
of the theatre, and the folly of the degenerate
nobility, were the causes of this alteration. For
both Pliny and Seneca assure us, that persons of the
very first rank and fashion were so scandalously
mean, as to pay the most obsequious court to the
players, to dangle at their levees, to attend them
openly in the streets like their slaves; and treat them
like the masters, instead of the servants of the publick.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a>
Every eminent player had his party, and these
ridiculous factions interested themselves so warmly
in the cause of their respective favourites, that the
theatres became a perpetual scene of riot and disorder.
The nobility mingled with the mob in these
absurd conflicts;<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> which always ended in bloodshed,
and frequently in murder. The remonstrances and
authority of the magistrates had so little effect, that
they were obliged to have recourse to the emperor.
Bad as Tiberius was, yet he was too wise to tolerate
such shameful licentiousness. He laid the case before
the senate, and informed them, that the players were
the cause of those scandalous riots which disturbed
the repose of the publick: that they spread lewdness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
and debauchery through all the chief families; that
they were arrived to such a height of profligacy and
insolence, through the protection of their factions,
that the authority of the senate itself was requisite to
restrain them within proper bounds. Upon this remonstrance
they were driven out of Italy as a publick
nuisance;<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> and Suetonius informs us, that all the
frequent and united petitions of the people could
never prevail upon Tiberius to recall them.</p>

<p>Augustus affected an extreme fondness for all
kinds of diversion; he invited the most celebrated
players of every denomination into Italy, and treated
the people, at an immense expense, with every kind
of entertainment, which the theatre or circus could
furnish. This is remarked as an instance of that
refined policy of which he was so thorough a master.
For that artful prince was not yet firmly settled in
his newly usurped power. He well knew, that if he
gave the people time to cool and reflect, they might
possibly thwart the execution of his ambitious
schemes. He therefore judged that the best expedient
to prepare them for the yoke of slavery would
be, to keep them constantly intoxicated by one perpetual
round of jollity and diversions. That this was
the opinion of thinking people, at that time, is evident
from that remarkably pertinent answer of Pylades
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
the player to Augustus, transmitted to us by Dion
Cassius. Pylades, as I have already observed, had
been banished by Augustus for a misdemeanor, but
pardoned and recalled to gratify the humour of
the people. At his return, when Augustus reproved
him for quarrelling with one Bathyllus, a person of
the same profession, but protected by his favourite
M&aelig;cenas; Pylades is reported to have made this
bold and sensible answer. &#8220;It is your true interest,
C&aelig;sar, that the people should idle away that time
upon us and our affairs, which they might otherwise
employ in prying too narrowly into your government.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<p>I am far from being an enemy to the stage. On
the contrary, I think the stage under proper regulations
might be rendered highly useful. For of all
our publick diversions, the stage, if purged from the
obscenity of farce, and the low buffoonery of pantomime,
is certainly capable of affording infinitely
the most rational, and the most manly entertainment.
But when I see the same disorders in our own theatres,
which were so loudly complained of in the
time of Tiberius; when the ridiculous contests between
contending players are judged to be of such
mighty importance, as to split the publick into the
same kind of factions; when these factions interest
themselves so warmly in the support of the supposed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
merit of their respective favourites, as to proceed
to riots, blows, and the most extravagant indecencies;
I cannot help wishing for the interposition
of the reforming spirit of Augustus. And when I
see the same insatiable fondness for diversions, the
same unmeaning taste (so justly ridiculed by Horace
in his countrymen) prevail in our own nation,<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> which
mark the most degenerate times of Greece and
Rome, I cannot but look upon them as a certain
indication of the frivolous and effeminate manners
of the present age.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />

<small>THE REAL CAUSE OF THE RAPID DECLENSION OF
THE ROMAN REPUBLICK.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dionysius</span> of Halicarnassus observes,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> that Romulus
formed his new government in many respects
after the model of that of Sparta, which accounts for
that great resemblance, we evidently meet with
between the Roman and Spartan constitutions. I
may add too, that we cannot help observing as great
a resemblance for some ages at least between the
manners of both those people. For we find the
same simplicity in their houses, diet and apparel;
the same contempt for wealth, and quite to the last
period of liberty, the same warlike genius. Publick
spirit and the love of their country was carried in
both states to the highest pitch of enthusiasm; it
was deaf to the voice of nature itself; and that amiable
virtue wore a kind of savage aspect at Rome
and Sparta. But the alteration of their manners
which alike preceded the loss both of the Spartan
and Roman liberty, will admit of no kind of comparison
either as to degree or progress. Luxury
and corruption stole in by very slow degrees, and
were never carried to any remarkable height amongst
the Spartans. But, as Sallust beautifully expresses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
it,<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> the Roman manners were precipitated at once
to the depth of corruption after the manner of a
resistless torrent. I observe that the destruction of
Carthage is fixed upon by that elegant historian, as
the &aelig;ra from which the rise of this rapid degeneracy
is to be dated. He assigns too the removal of the
dread occasioned by that dangerous rival, as the
cause of this sudden and astonishing change. Because
according to his reasoning, they could then
give a full loose to the impetuous fury of their
passions, without restraint or fear. But the cause
here assigned is by no means equal to the effect.
For though it might contribute in some measure to
accelerate the progress of luxury, and consequently
the corruption of their manners; yet the real cause
of their sudden degeneracy was widely different.</p>

<p>The Romans founded their system of policy, at
the very origin of their state, upon that best and
wisest principle, &#8220;the fear of the gods, a firm
belief of a divine superintending providence, and a
future state of rewards and punishments:&#8221; their
children were trained up in this belief from tender
infancy, which took root and grew up with them
by the influence of an excellent education, where
they had the benefit of example as well as precept.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Hence we read of no heathen nation in the world,
where both the publick and private duties of religion
were so strictly adhered to, and so scrupulously
observed as amongst the Romans. They imputed
their good or bad success to their observance of
these duties, and they received publick prosperities
or publick calamities, as blessings conferred, or
punishments inflicted by their gods. Their historians
hardly ever give us an account of any defeat
received by that people,<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> which they do not ascribe
to the omission, or contempt of some religious ceremony
by their generals. For though the ceremonies
there mentioned, justly appear to us instances
of the most absurd, and most extravagant superstition,
yet as they were esteemed essential acts of
religion by the Romans, they must consequently
carry all the force of religious principle. We
neither exceeded, says Cicero,<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> speaking of his
countrymen, the Spaniards in number, nor did we
excel the Gauls in strength of body, nor the Carthaginians
in craft, nor the Greeks in arts or sciences.
But we have indisputably surpassed all the nations
in the universe in piety and attachment to religion,<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a>
and in the only point, which can be called true wisdom,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
a thorough conviction, that all things here
below are directed, and governed by divine providence.
To this principle alone Cicero wisely
attributes the grandeur and good fortune of his
country. For what man is there, says he, who is
convinced of the existence of the gods, but must be
convinced at the same time, that our mighty empire
owes its origin,<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> its increase, and its preservation,
to the protecting care of their divine providence.
A plain proof that these continued to be the real
sentiments of the wiser Romans, even in the corrupt
times of Cicero. From this principle proceeded
that respect for, and submission to their
laws, and that temperance, moderation, and contempt
for wealth, which are the best defence against the
encroachments of injustice and oppression. Hence
too arose that inextinguishable love for their country,
which, next to the gods, they looked upon as
the chief object of veneration. This they carried to
such a height of enthusiasm,<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> as to make every
human tie of social love, natural affection, and self-preservation
give way to this duty to their dearer
country. Because they not only loved their country
as their common mother, but revered it as a place
which was dear to their gods; which they had destined
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
to give laws to the rest of the universe,<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> and
consequently favoured with their peculiar care and
protection. Hence proceeded that obstinate and
undaunted courage, that insuperable contempt of
danger, and death itself in defence of their country,
which complete the idea of the Roman character as
it is drawn by historians in the virtuous ages of
the republick. As long as the manners of the
Romans were regulated by this first great principle
of religion, they were free and invincible. But the
atheistical doctrine of Epicurus,<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> which insinuated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
itself at Rome, under the respectable name of philosophy,
after their acquaintance with the Greeks,
undermined and destroyed this ruling principle. I
allow that luxury, by corrupting manners, had weakened
this principle, and prepared the Romans for
the reception of atheism, which is the never-failing
attendant of luxury. But as long as this principle
remained, it controlled manners, and checked the
progress of luxury in proportion to its influence.
But when the introduction of atheism had destroyed
this principle, the great bar to corruption was removed,
and the passions at once let loose to run
their full career without check, or control. The
introduction therefore of the atheistical tenets attributed
to Epicurus,<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> was the real cause of that rapid
depravity of the Roman manners, which has never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
been satisfactorily accounted for, either by Sallust,
or any other historians.</p>

<p>The learned, I know, are not a little divided in their
opinions about Epicurus. But a disquisition into
what were, or were not the real tenets of that philosopher,
would be wholly foreign to my purpose. By
the doctrine of the Epicureans, I mean that system
which Lucretius has dressed up in his poem with all
the beauties of poetry, and all the elegance of diction.
This, like the rest of the atheistick systems, which
are attributed to most of the Grecian philosophers,
is pregnant with the wildest absurdities that ever
entered into the human imagination. Epicurus, if
Lucretius has given us his genuine tenets, ascribes
the formation of the universe to the fortuitous concourse
of senseless atoms of matter.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> His master,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
Democritus, from whom he borrowed his system,
asserts the same. But Epicurus has exceeded him
in absurdity. For Democritus, if we may credit
Plutarch, endowed his atoms with a certain living-intelligence,
which Epicurus scorns to make use of.
He boldly deduces life, intelligence, and free-will
itself, from the direct, oblique, and other various
motions of his inanimate atoms. He admits a sort
of insignificant beings, whom he terms gods; but
as he would not allow them to have any hand in the
formation of his universe, so neither will he suffer
them to have the least share in the conduct of it. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
has showed them plainly, that he could do without
them, and, as he has made them so egregiously insignificant
as to be able to do neither good nor harm,
he has packed them off at a distance, to live an indolent,
lazy life, and to divert themselves just as they
think proper. Thus he has got rid of the troublesome
doctrine of a divine superintending Providence.
Sometimes he forgets himself, and seems to deny
their very existence. For he tells us in one place,
that the whole universe contains nothing but matter
and empty space, or what arises from the casual concurrence
of these two principles:<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> consequently
that no third nature, different from these two, can
possibly be proved to exist either by the cognizance
of our senses, or by the utmost efforts of our reasoning
faculty. He teaches, that the soul is composed of
the finest, and most subtile atoms, consequently discerptible
and mortal. That the identity of man consists
in the union of these finer corpuscles with the
grosser ones, which compose the body. That, at their
disunion by death, the soul evaporates, and is dissipated
in the upper regions, from whence it first distilled,
and the same man exists no more.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> Nay he is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
so amazingly absurd as to assert, that if the soul,<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a>
after its separation, should still retain its consciousness,
and, after a length of time, by some lucky
jumble of his atoms, should happen to animate
another body, this new compound would be quite a
different man: consequently, that this new man
would be no more interested in the actions of the
former, than the former would be responsible for the
behaviour of the latter, or for that of any future man,
who might happen hereafter to be produced by
another casual assemblage of the atoms of the same
soul, united to those of another body. This doctrine
is plainly stolen from the Pythagorean system of the
transmigration of souls; but mutilated, and miserably
perverted to the purposes of atheism. The absurdities
in this wild philosophy are so self-evident, that
to attempt a refutation of them, would be an affront
to common sense. Yet, from this source, these philosophers
draw their pretended consolations against
the fear of death. That at death the identity of the
man absolutely ceases, and we totally lose our existence.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a>
Yet, from these excellent comforters, our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
modern scepticks have revived their senseless tenet of
annihilation to serve the cause of libertinism. The
grand <i>desideratum</i>, in libertinism, is, to be able to
give an unbounded loose to the sensual passions, to
their very utmost extent, without any impertinent
hints from a certain disagreeable monitor, called
conscience, and the dread of an after-reckoning.
Now as both these terrors are removed by this system
of annihilation, it is no wonder that libertines, who
abound in a corrupt licentious age, should fly eagerly
to so comfortable a doctrine, which at once silences
those enemies to their pleasures. This is the creed
introduced by the sect of Epicurus amongst the
Romans, which easily accounts for that sudden, and
universal revolution in their manners. For manners
can never be so effectually, and so speedily depraved,
as by a total extinction of all religious principle; and
all religious principle must be necessarily subverted
wherever this doctrine of annihilation is received.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a>
I allow that Lucretius gives us some excellent
maxims from Epicurus, and inveighs in many places
against the vices of his countrymen. But the cheat
is too gross and palpable, and only proves, that he
has gilt over the pill of atheism to make it go down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
more smoothly.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> For how can a superstructure
stand when the foundation is taken away; and of
what service is the best system of morality when the
sanction of future rewards and punishments, the
great motive which should enforce the practice, is
removed by the denial of a Providence, and the doctrine
of annihilation? Cicero informs us, that all the
fine things, which Epicurus asserts of the existence
of his gods, and their excellent nature, are mere
grimace, and only thrown out to screen him from
censure.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> For he could not be ignorant, that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>laws of his country punished every man with the
utmost severity, who struck at that fundamental
principle of all religion, the existence of a Deity.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Cicero therefore, who had thoroughly examined his
tenets, affirms him, by his own principles, to have
been a downright atheist.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> For in reality, a man
who should assert the existence of such idle gods, as
are neither capable of doing good or hurt, must, if
he expects to be believed, be a greater fool than the
man, &#8220;who says in his heart there is no God at all.&#8221;
Yet this strange system, though fraught with such
absurdities and contradictions as could scarce be
palmed upon the genius of a Hottentot, has been
implicitly swallowed by too many of those gentlemen,
who affect to call themselves the <i>esprits forts</i> of the
present age. These are the atheistical tenets of
Epicurus, preserved by Lucretius in his beautiful
poem, which, like poison, conveyed in sweets, please
and murder at the same time.</p>

<p>The Greeks were early infected with this execrable
doctrine, and shew the effect it had upon their
manners by their violation of publick faith, and contempt
for the most sacred ties of religion. Trust,
says Polybius, but a single talent to a Greek, who has
been used to finger the publick money, and though
you have the security of ten counterparts, drawn up
by as many publick notaries, backed by as many
seals, and the testimony of twice as many witnesses,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
yet, with all these precautions, you cannot possibly
prevent him from proving a rogue.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> Whilst the
Romans, who, by their various offices, are intrusted
with large sums of publick money, pay so conscientious
a regard to the religion of their office-oath,
that they were never known to violate their faith,
though restrained only by that single tie. How
greatly they deviated from this rectitude of manners,
after these infidel tenets had taken root amongst
them, we may learn from Cicero, in his orations and
epistles. Sallust too will inform us, how extremely
common the crime of perjury was grown, in that
severe reproach, which Lucius Philippus, a patrician,
makes to Lepidus, the consul, before the whole
senate. That he neither stood in awe of men or
gods, whom he had so frequently injured, and defied
by his villanies and perjuries.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p>Polybius gives it as his real opinion, that nothing
shows the superior excellence of the civil government
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
of the Romans, to that of other people, so much as
those religious sentiments with respect to their gods,
which they constantly inculcated and supported.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> He
affirms too his real sentiments to be, that the chief
support and preservation of the Roman republick
arose from that awful fear of the gods, which was so
much ridiculed, and exploded by the Grecians. I
have taken the liberty to render &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#962;,
the Grecians, who are evidently pointed at in this
passage.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> For so just and accurate a writer as Polybius
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
could not be ignorant, that the Grecians were
the only people in the world at that time, who had
been debauched into atheism by the pernicious tenets
of Epicurus. Polybius firmly believed the existence
of a Deity, and the interposition of a divine superintending
Providence, though he was an enemy to
superstition. Yet when he observed the good effects
produced amongst the Romans by their religion,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a>
though carried even to the highest possible degree
of superstition, and the remarkable influence it had
upon their manners in private life, as well as upon their
publick counsels, he concludes it to be<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> the result
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
of a wise, and consummate policy in the ancient
legislators. He therefore very justly censures
those as wrong-headed, and wretchedly bungling
politicians, who at that time endeavoured to eradicate
the fear of an after-reckoning, and the terrors of an
hell, out of the minds of a people. Yet how few
years ago did we see this miserably mistaken policy
prevail in our own country, during the whole administration
of some late power-engrossing ministers.
Compelled at all events to secure a majority in parliament
to support themselves against the efforts of
opposition, they found the greatest obstacle to their
schemes arise from those principles of religion,
which yet remained amongst the people. For though
a great number of the electors were not at all averse
to the bribe, yet their consciences were too tender to
digest perjury. To remove this troublesome test at
elections, which is one of the bulwarks of our constitution,
would be impracticable. To weaken or destroy
those principles, upon which the oath was founded,
and from which it derived its force and obligation,
would equally answer the purpose, and destroy all
publick virtue at the same time. The bloody and
deep felt effects of that hypocrisy, which prevailed
in the time of Cromwell, had driven great numbers
of the sufferers into the contrary extreme. When
therefore so great a part of the nation was already
prejudiced against whatever carried the appearance
of a stricter piety, it is no wonder that shallow superficial
reasoners, who have not logick enough to distinguish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
between the use and abuse of a thing, should
readily embrace those atheistical tenets, which were
imported, and took root in the voluptuous, and
thoughtless reign of Charles the second. But that
solid learning, which revived after the restoration,
easily baffled the efforts of open and avowed atheism,
which from that time has taken shelter under the
less obnoxious name of deism. For the principles
of modern deism, when stript of that disguise which
has been artfully thrown over them, to deceive those
who hate the fatigue of thinking, and are ever ready
to admit any conclusion in argument, which is
agreeable to their passions, without examining the
premises, are in reality the same with those of Epicurus,
as transmitted to us by Lucretius. The
influence therefore, which they had upon the manners
of the Greeks and Romans, will readily account
for those effects which we experience from them in
our own country, where they so fatally prevail. To
patronise and propagate their principles, was the best
expedient which the narrow selfish policy of those
ministers could suggest. For their greatest extent
of genius never reached higher, than a fertility in
temporary shifts and expedients, to stave off the evil
day of national account, which they so much dreaded.
They were sensible that the wealth and luxury, which
are the general effects of an extensive trade in a state
of profound peace, had already greatly hurt the
morals of the people, and smoothed the way for their
grand system of corruption. Far from checking this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
licentious spirit of luxury and dissipation, they left
it to its full and natural effects upon the manners,
whilst, in order to corrupt the principles of the people,
they retained, at the publick expense, a venal set
of the most shameless miscreants that ever abused
the liberty of the press, or insulted the religion of
their country. To the administration of such ministers,
which may justly be termed the grand &aelig;ra of
corruption, we owe that fatal system of bribery,
which has so greatly affected the morals of the electors
in almost every borough in the kingdom. To
that too we may justly attribute the present contempt,
and disregard of the sacred obligation of an
oath, which is the strongest bond of society, and the
best security and support of civil government.</p>

<p>I have now, I hope, satisfactorily accounted for
that rapid, and unexampled degeneracy of the Romans,
which brought on the total subversion of that
mighty republick. The cause of this sudden, and
violent change of the Roman manners, has been just
hinted at by the sagacious Montesquieu, but, to my
great surprise, has not been duly attended to by any
one historian I have yet met with.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> I have showed
too, how the same cause has been working the same
effects in our own nation, as it invariably will in every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
country where those fatally destructive principles are
admitted. As the real end of all history is instruction,
I have held up a just portrait of the Roman
manners, in the times immediately preceding the
loss of their liberty, to the inspection of my countrymen,
that they may guard in time against those
calamities which will be the inevitable consequence
of the like degeneracy. The unpromising aspect of
our affairs, at the time of the sudden and unexpected
alliance between the houses of Bourbon and Austria,
gave the first rise to these reflections. But as the
interests and situation of this kingdom, with respect
to France, are so greatly analogous to those of Carthage
with respect to Rome, I shall proceed to compare
the different manners, policy, and military conduct
of those two rival nations. By thus comparing
the different policy of these warlike people, whose
views and interests were as diametrically opposite,
and as irreconcilable as those of Great Britain and
France, we may learn the superior advantages which
each enjoyed, and the different disadvantages arising
from their different policy, which each people laboured
under, during their long and inveterate contests.
The result, which I most sincerely wish from
this inquiry, is, that we may avoid those egregious
blunders on the side of the Romans, which reduced
them to the very brink of ruin, and those more capital
defects on the part of the Carthaginians, which
terminated in the utter destruction of their very
being as a people.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />

<small>CARTHAGINIANS AND ROMANS COMPARED.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> origin of both these people seems alike to
have been extremely low. Romulus, according to
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, could form no more than
three thousand foot and three hundred horse out of
his whole people, where every individual was obliged
to be a soldier. The Tyrians, who accompanied
Dido in her flight from her brother Pymalion, could
be but few in number from the very circumstances
of their escape from an avaricious and vigilant
tyrant.</p>

<p>Romulus, to supply this defect, not only opened
an asylum for all fugitives, whom he admitted as subjects,
but in all his conquests over the neighbouring
states, annexed the lands to his own small territory,
and incorporated the prisoners amongst his own Roman
citizens. By this masterly policy, notwithstanding
the number of men he must necessarily have
lost during a warlike reign of thirty-seven years, he
left at his death, according to Dionysius, forty-five
thousand foot and a thousand horse. As the same
policy was pursued under the republican as under
the regal government, the Romans, though involved
in continual wars, found themselves not inferior in
number even to those nations, who were reputed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
most populous. Dionysius, from whom I have
taken this account, extols the policy of the Romans
in this point as greatly superior to that of the Grecians.
The Spartans, says that judicious historian,
were obliged to give up their dominion over Greece
by their single defeat at Leuctra; as the loss of the
battle of Ch&aelig;ronea reduced the Thebans and Athenians
to the sad necessity of yielding up the government
of Greece, as well as their liberty, to the
Macedonians. These misfortunes Dionysius imputes
to the mistaken policy of the Grecians, who were,
in general, unwilling to communicate the privileges
of their respective states to foreigners. Whereas
the Romans, who admitted even their enemies to the
rights of citizenship, derived additional strength even
from their misfortunes. And he affirms, that after
the terrible defeat of Cann&aelig;, where out of eighty-six
thousand little more than three thousand three hundred
and seventy men escaped, the Romans owed the
preservation of their state, not to the benevolence of
fortune, as some, he says, imagine, but to the number
of their disciplined militia, which enabled them
to encounter every danger. I am sensible that the
remarks of Dionysius, which have been adopted by
many of our modern writers, are extremely just in
relation to the Thebans and Athenians. Because as
the former of these people endeavoured to extend
their dominions by arms, the latter both by arms and
commerce, both states ought, like the Romans, to
have attracted as many foreigners as possibly they
could, to enable them to execute plans which require
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
an inexhaustible supply of people. But the exclusion
of foreigners ought not, in my opinion, to be censured
as a defect in the Spartan constitution. Because
it is evident, from the testimony of Polybius
and Plutarch, that the great end which Lycurgus
proposed by his laws, was not to increase the wealth
or power of his countrymen, but to preserve the
purity of their manners; as his military regulations,
according to the same authors, were not calculated
for making conquests and serving the purposes of
ambition, but for the defence and security of his republick.
I observe too in proof of my opinion, that
the Spartans gradually lost their virtue, and afterwards
their liberty, only so far as they deviated from
the institutions of their legislator.... But I return from the
digression into which this subject unavoidably
led me.</p>

<p>In our researches back into the remote times of
antiquity, we must lay hold of whatever helps we are
able to meet with. If Justin therefore is to be credited,
Dido not only received considerable assistance
from a colony of Tyrians which she found settled in
Utica, but admitted great numbers of the natives
who settled with her in the new city, and consequently
became Carthaginians.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> I may add too in proof of
this account, that unless the Carthaginians had long
pursued this wise policy, it is scarce possible by the
course of nature, that the Tyrians alone could have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
multiplied by propagation to so prodigious a degree,
as to be able to furnish men sufficient to raise and
carry on that extensive commerce, and plant those
numerous colonies which we meet with in the earlier
ages of their history.</p>

<p>As to their constitution, Rome and Carthage
were both republicks, both free, and their form of
government nearly similar, as far as we can collect
from history. Two supreme magistrates,<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> annually
elected, the senate, and the people, formed the body
politick in each republick. The annual elections of
their chief magistrates were a permanent source of
division and faction alike in both; a defect which
Lycurgus guarded against in the Spartan government,
where the chief magistracy was perpetual and
hereditary. The senate in both nations was composed
out of the most respectable and greatest men
in each republick. At Rome the consuls chose the
senators with the approbation of the people, but at
last the censors arrogated that power to themselves.
At Carthage, as Aristotle informs us, the senators
were elected; but as he has no where told us who
were the electors, it is most probable, that the right
of election was the inherent privilege of the people,
since he censures that republick as too much leaning
towards democracy. At Rome, in the virtuous times
of that republick, birth and merit alone entitled the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
possessor to a place in the senate, as well as the
chief offices in the state. At Carthage, though
birth and merit seem to have been qualifications
indispensably necessary, yet even these could not
succeed,<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> unless the candidate was at the same time
master of such a fortune as would enable him to
support his dignity with lustre.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> This Aristotle
censures as a defect. For he looks upon all that
merit, which was unsupported by the proper proportion
of wealth, as so much lost to the Carthaginians;
and he lays down that maxim in their government,
as the real cause of that undue respect for wealth,
and that lust of gain, which prevailed so much in that
republick. But the sentiments of this philosopher,
like those of his master Plato, are, I fear, too ideal
to be reduced to practice. For he does not seem to
attend to the different genius of different nations, but
aims at adjusting the balance of power in his republick
by the nice standard of philosophick theory.
The genius of nations differs perhaps as much as
their climate and situation, which seem (at least in
some degree) to be the natural cause of that difference.
The republicks of Sparta and Rome were
both military, and military glory stamped the primary
character of both these people. The republick of
Carthage, like that of their ancestors, the Tyrians,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
was commercial. Hence the lust of gain marked
their ruling character. Their military character
arose from the necessity of defending that wealth
which their commerce had acquired. Hence military
glory was but a secondary passion, and generally
subservient to their lust of gain. Unless we attend
to the different ruling passion, which forms the different
character of each republick, we shall never be
able to make such a comparison as will do equal
justice to each people. At Sparta and Rome wealth
was despised, when put in competition with honour,
and poverty joined with merit formed the most
estimable of all characters. Quite different maxims
prevailed at Carthage. Wealth with them was the
chief support of merit, and nothing was so contemptible
as poverty. Hence the Carthaginians, who were
well acquainted with the power and influence of
wealth, required the additional qualifications of an
ample fortune in all candidates for the senatorial
dignity, and publick employments. For they judged
that such men would be less exposed to the temptations
of corruption, and at the same time more
anxious for the welfare of a state, in which they were
so deeply interested by their private property. That
this was the real state of the case, at Carthage, notwithstanding
the suggestions of Aristotle and the
Greek and Roman historians, may, I think, be fairly
proved from the behaviour of their senate and the
choice of their officers, which ought certainly to be
admitted as the best evidence. For we constantly
find all their publick employments filled up with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
men of the greatest families, and (unless when the
intrigues of faction sometimes prevailed) of the
greatest abilities. We find in general the same firm
and steady attachment to the service of their country,
and the same indefatigable zeal for extending
the territories and power of their republick. Nor
does the most partial historian charge any one of
them with sacrificing the honour and interest of his
country to any foreign power for money: a practice
which was shamefully common amongst the Roman
generals in the time of Jugurtha. Hence we may,
I think, assign the true reason, why the greatest
families in Carthage (as we are informed by historians)
thought it no way derogatory to their honour
to engage in commerce. For as this is most probably
to be understood of the younger sons of their nobility,
the true motive seems to arise, not from
avarice, as their enemies object, but from a view of
raising such a fortune, as might qualify them for
admission into the senate, or any of the great employments.
Hence too it is evident, that a regulation
which might be highly useful and salutary in an
opulent commercial republick, would be greatly injurious
to such military republicks as Rome and Sparta,
by corrupting their manners. We need no
other proof than the fate of those two republicks,
who both owed their ruin to the introduction of that
wealth, which was unknown to their virtuous ancestors.
The Carthaginian senate seems to have been
much more numerous than the Roman. For at
Carthage there was a select standing committee
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
established, of one hundred and four of the most respectable
members, to keep a watchful eye over the
great families, and repress any attempts which their
ambition might make to subvert the constitution.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a>
To this committee all their commanding officers by
sea and land, without exception, were obliged to give
a strict account of their conduct at the end of every
campaign. We may therefore properly term it the
Carthaginian court-martial. Out of this venerable
body another select committee was formed of five
members only, who were most conspicuous for their
probity, ability, and experience. These served without
fee or salary; as glory, and the love of their
country, were esteemed motives sufficient to engage
men of their superior rank and character, to serve
the publick with zeal and fidelity.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> For which
reason they were not chosen by lot, but elected by
merit. Their power was very extensive. Their
office was for life, and they filled up any vacancy in
their own body, out of the one hundred and four, and
all vacancies in that grand committee, out of the
rest of the senate, by their own authority and at their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
own discretion.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> They were the supreme judges
besides in all causes whatsoever without appeal.
The institution of this grand committee, in my
opinion, exceeded every thing in the Roman policy.
For it preserved their state from all those violent
concussions, which so frequently shook, and at last
totally subverted the Roman republick.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> But the
power of the committee of five was exorbitant, and
dangerous to the lives and fortunes of their fellow-citizens.
The proof is from fact. For at the conclusion
of the second Punick war, they had made so
arbitrary an use of their power, and were grown so
odious to the people, that the great Hannibal regulated
that amongst other abuses, and procured a law,
which made that office annual and elective, with a
clause forbidding any future alteration. Whether the
Carthaginian senators enjoyed their seats for life, or
whether they were liable to be expelled for any misdemeanour,
and by whom, are points in which history
is quite silent. At Rome, as the censors had the
power of promoting to that dignity, so they had
equally the power of expelling any member for bad
manners, by the single ceremony of leaving out his
name when they called over the list of the senate.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
I cannot help thinking this a great defect in the
Roman polity: since it threw the power of garbling
and modelling the senate into the hands of two men,
who were liable to be corrupted to serve the ends of
faction. A power which ought never to be lodged in
so few hands in a country which enjoys the blessings
of liberty. For how serviceable soever it might
have been, as a curb to licentiousness in the earlier
ages of that republick; yet Cicero, in his oration for
A. Cluentius, inveighs bitterly against the abuse of
the censorial power in his time, and gives several
instances where it was made subservient to the ends
of faction in modelling the senate. And he seems to
fear that the censors list may bring as many calamities
upon the citizens as the late most inhuman proscription;
and that the point of the censors pen may
prove as terrible as the sword of their late dictator.
C. Nepos, in the life of Hamilcar, takes notice of an
officer of the same nature amongst the Carthaginians,
to whose inspection the greatest men in that republick
seem to have been subject. But it does not
appear from history, whether his power extended so
far as to expel a senator. Should a bad prince, or a
wicked minister, ever be invested with the power of
weeding the house, and modelling the parliament at
pleasure, there would be an end of our constitution
and liberty.</p>

<p>In the Roman senate all questions were decided
(as in our parliament) by a majority of voices. At
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Carthage no law could pass, unless the senate were
unanimous, like the Polish diet. One single veto
from any one member, took the question out of the
hands of the senate, and gave up the ultimate decision
to the people, who were the <i>dernier resort</i> of
all power. This Aristotle censures as inclining more
towards democracy than was consistent with the just
rules of a well regulated republick.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> Because the
magistrates were not only obliged to open all the
different opinions and debates of the senators upon
the question, in the hearing of the people, who were
the absolute and decisive judges in all these cases of
appeal; but any one, even the lowest fellow in the
mob, might freely give his opinion in opposition
just as he thought proper. A source of endless
discord, anarchy, and confusion! A kind of polity,
as Aristotle observes, unknown in any other form of
republican government.</p>

<p>In this point, I think the Roman polity far preferable
to the Carthaginian, except in those abuses
of the tribunitial power, which so frequently happened
towards the decline of that republick. But
when any one turbulent, seditious tribune, instigated
by ambition, or corrupted by a faction (which in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
those times was generally the case) could by his
single veto, stop all proceedings of the senate, and
haul the case before the people; nay when he could
drag the supreme magistrates, the consuls themselves,
to prison, by his sole authority, and could
commit the most outrageous, and most shameful
acts of licentiousness with impunity, because their
office rendered their persons sacred by law, I esteem
the Carthaginian polity infinitely more eligible.
For that fear and jealousy of ceding any part of the
authority, which is so natural to men in power,
would always be a strong motive to union in a Carthaginian
senate; because it would naturally induce
any member, rather to give up his private opinion,
than suffer an essential part of their power to devolve
to the people. But the Roman tribunitial
power, which was in constant opposition to the
senatorial, drew at last by much too great a weight
into the democratick scale, and in the last period of
their liberty was a principal leading cause of the ruin
of that republick. For as the senate was unsupported
by a third power so essentially requisite to
preserve the balance of government in its due &aelig;quipoise,
the tribunes perpetually fomented and kept up
those terrible feuds, which brought on anarchy, and
terminated in absolute insupportable tyranny.</p>

<p>The condition of the Roman populace before the
erection of the tribunitial power, seems, in my judgement,
to have been little better than that state of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
vassalage, which the peasants groan under in Poland.
The relation between patron and client amongst the
Romans, seems to be something analogous to the
relation between lord and vassal, with this difference,
that the client had the free choice of his patron,
which the vassal has not with respect to the lord.
At least it is certain, if we may credit the Roman
historians, that their people were subject to equal,
if not greater exactions and oppressions from the
Patricians. How heavy these were, we may learn
from the numerous mutinies, insurrections, and that
great secession, which compelled the Patricians to
create the tribunitial office in their favour. This
new office occasioned a great revolution in their new
government, and produced those perpetual conflicts
between the aristocratick and democratick powers,
which fill the history of that republick. The Patricians
had recourse frequently to their only resource
a dictator with absolute power, to defend them from
the insolence of the tribunes. But this was only a
temporary expedient. The people renewed their
attacks, until they had abolished the distinct prerogatives
arising from birth and family, and laid open
all honours, even the consulship, and dictatorship,
the supreme magistracy of all, to the free admission
of their own body. The people were highly elated
with these repeated victories, as they imagined
them, over their old enemies the Patricians, but
they were quickly sensible, that in fact, they were
only the dupes of their ambitious leaders. The
most opulent and powerful of the Plebeians, by serving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
the high offices of the state, acquired the title
of nobles, in contradistinction to those, who were
descended from the Patrician families, who still
retained their ancient appellation. These new nobles,
many of whom had crept into the senate, sided
constantly with the Patricians in all disputes and
contests with their former friends, the people, and
were generally their greatest enemies. The Patricians,
strengthened by this new acquisition of power,
were frequently too hard for the tribunes. In those
memorable contests with the two Gracchi, who
endeavoured in their tribuneship to revive the Agrarian
law (calculated to divide the conquered lands
among the poor citizens) the dispute seems to
have lain wholly between the rich and the poor: for
the nobles and rich Plebeians were as unwilling to
part with their land, as the Patricians. This strengthened
the Patricians so much, that they were able in
each of those contests, to quell the efforts of the
people by force, and quash the whole affair by the
death of both the Gracchi.</p>

<p>It has been a general remark of most writers,
both ancient and modern, that the Roman republick
owed its preservation to the firmness and wisdom of
the senate, and the subordinate obedience of the
people: and that the republick of Carthage must
ascribe its ruin to that ascendency, which the people
had usurped over the authority of the senate. The
reverse of this seems to be the truth. We meet
with but one instance in history, where the power of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
the Carthaginian people over-ruled the authority of
their senate, so far as to compel them to act contrary
to their opinion. This was that shameful violation
of the law of nations in seizing the transports which
were bringing necessaries to Scipio&#8217;s camp, during
the truce he had granted that they might send ambassadours
to Rome to negotiate a peace with the
Roman senate. For though they threatened violence
to the senate, if they submitted to those hard
terms which were imposed by Scipio after the defeat
at Zama; yet they were easily reduced to obedience
by Hannibal, and resigned the whole affair to the
decision of the senate. The Roman history, on the
contrary, is one continued detail of animosities, and
frequently most bloody contests, between the senate
and the people in their perpetual struggles for power.
And the frequent elections of that low Plebeian
Marius to the consular dignity, in opposition to the
Patricians, (the malignant effects of the over-bearing
power of the people) opened that scene of blood and
anarchy, which ended only in the utter subversion of
their liberty and constitution.</p>

<p>The judicious Montesquieu observes, &#8220;that the
Carthaginians grew rich much sooner than the
Romans, and consequently sunk much sooner into
corruption.&#8221; He adds too; &#8220;that whilst merit alone
entitled the possessor to the great employments at
Rome, every thing which the publick at Carthage
had the power of bestowing, was venal.&#8221;... The
former part of this assertion is too general to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
admitted without proper restrictions; the latter is a
plain transcript from Polybius. The Carthaginians
must have been rich several ages before the Romans.
For both Herodotus and Thucydides (who was but
thirteen years younger) take notice of them as a
very formidable maritime power, a circumstance
which could only arise from their naval genius and
extensive commerce. Yet we find no instance of
their being corrupt, until the conclusion of the second
Punick war, when Hannibal reformed those shameful
abuses, which had crept into the management of
the publick revenue, and restrained that power which
the committee of five had usurped over the lives and
fortunes of their fellow-citizens. As for the quotation
out of Polybius, whose country was at that time
a province to the Romans, with whom he resided
only as a state prisoner; I esteem it as no more
than a compliment to the Romans&#8217; vanity at the
expense of the Carthaginians, whose very name was
odious to that people. Or very probably he might
bring that charge against the Carthaginians, as a
hint to show the consequences of the same species
of corruption, which, even in his time, had found
entrance amongst the Romans.</p>

<p>As to religion, both nations were equally superstitious.
If many of the religious ceremonies amongst
the Romans were absurd and childish, it must be
owned that the Carthaginian worship, like that of
their ancestors the Canaanites, from whom they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
received it, was truly diabolical.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> But it is by no
means candid to judge of the natural bent and temper
of a people, from effects produced in their minds by
superstition. For the same superstition which enjoins
such horrid rites, will naturally place the chief efficacy
of the sacrifice in the zeal and sincerity of the
offerer. Consequently the highest degree of merit
in such oblations, will consist in stifling every human
affection, and over-ruling nature. Thus in the Carthaginian
idolatry, the softer sex, as more susceptible
of tenderness for their offspring, were required
to attend in person. They were even compelled,<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a>
upon this dreadful occasion, to affect all the joy and
cheerfulness of festivity, because, as Plutarch informs
us, if a sigh or a tear escaped them, the merit of the
offering would be absolutely lost, and themselves
liable to a fine. That the Carthaginians were no
more void of parental affection than other nations, is
evident from that pious fraud they had so long practised,<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a>
of secretly buying up poor children, whom
they substituted as victims to their bloody deity
instead of their own. But after a great defeat which
they received from Agathocles, they attributed their
ill fortune to the resentment of their god for their
repeated sacrilege. They sacrificed two hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
children of the first families in Carthage,<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> and three
hundred other persons offered themselves as voluntary
victims to atone for a crime, to which the
highest degree of guilt was affixed by their impious
religion. The Roman superstition must in general
be acquitted of the charge of inhumanity. The
only tendency towards it, was in the custom of
inhuming alive such of the vestal virgins, as had
violated their vow of chastity.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> But the bloody and
frequent shows of the gladiators, which were the
delight of the Romans, fix an indelible blot on the
character of a brave people.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> Historians in general
brand the Carthaginians with cruelty and inhumanity.
If the charge is just, it must be chiefly
attributed to that execrable custom of human sacrifices,
which always prevailed amongst that people.
Nor do I in the least doubt, but that savage ferocity,
which the Romans were so guilty of in war, was in
a great measure owing to those barbarous spectacles,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
where wounds, and murder in cold blood,
made the most agreeable part of the entertainment.</p>

<p>As to publick virtue or love of their country, the
Carthaginians were no way inferior to the Romans.
The intrepid behaviour of the Phil&aelig;ni,<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> two Carthaginian
brothers, who consented to be buried alive to
enlarge the boundaries of their country, equals the
most heroick instance of that kind of enthusiasm,
which the Roman story can boast of. The fate of
Macheus, Bomilcar, Hanno, and others, afford undeniable
proof, that neither birth, dignity, nor the
greatest services, could screen that man from the
most ignominious death, who made the least attempt
to subvert the liberty of his country. I have before
taken notice of the <i>punica fides</i>, or that proverbial
want of sincerity, which has been so often objected
by the Roman historians: but I cannot help observing
with the more impartial Montesquieu,<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> &#8220;that
the Romans never made peace with sincerity and
good faith, but always took care to insert such conditions
as, in the end, proved the ruin of the people
with whom they treated: that the peace they granted
was no more than a politick suspension of arms,
until an opportunity offered of completing their
conquests: that it was their invariable maxim to
foment divisions among the neighbouring powers,
and by siding alternately with either party, as they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
found it most conducive to their own interest, play
one against the other, until they had reduced all
equally into provinces: that they frequently employed
the subtilty and ambiguity of terms in their own
language, to finesse and chicane in their treaties.&#8221;
Thus they cheated the &AElig;tolians by the ambiguous
phrase of yielding themselves up to the faith of the
Roman people.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> The poor &AElig;tolians imagined, that
the term implied only alliance. But the Romans
soon convinced them, that what they meant by it, was
absolute subjection. They destroyed Carthage under
sanction of the most vile equivocation,<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> pretending,
&#8220;that though they promised that deluded people to
preserve their state, they did not mean to grant them
their city, which word they had purposely omitted.&#8221;
Maxims which the French have steadily and too
successfully pursued, and are still pursuing!...
Montesquieu very judiciously observes &#8220;... that the
Romans were ambitious from the lust of domination:
the Carthaginians from the lust of gain.&#8221; This
accounts for the different reception which commerce
met with in the two nations. At Carthage commerce
was esteemed the most honourable of all
employments. At Rome commerce was held in
contempt. It was there looked upon as the proper
occupation of slaves only, and disgraceful to a free
citizen. Thus the one loved war for the sake of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
glory and acquiring dominion; the other looked
upon war as a means of acquiring wealth, and
extending commerce. The Romans plundered the
vanquished enemy to make a parade with their
wealth in the triumphal procession. The Carthaginians
fleeced not only their enemies, but their
tributary provinces, and oppressed their allies, to
feed their own private avarice, as well as that of the
publick. The oppressions of the Carthaginian generals
in Spain lost them all their allies. The wiser
policy of Scipio attached those allies unalterably to
the Romans. The exactions of their rapacious governors
in the African provinces, were the sources of
perpetual revolts, upon the approach of any invader,
from a desire of changing masters. When Scipio
landed, he was joined by all those provinces, who
looked upon the Romans as their deliverers. As
soon as luxury had introduced avarice and corruption
amongst the Romans, their generals and governours
pursued the same destructive maxims, which was
one leading cause of the final ruin of both the
western and eastern empires.</p>

<p>There cannot be a stronger proof of a weak or a
corrupt administration, than when indigent and necessitous
men are appointed to the government of
distant provinces, from no other motive than party
merit, and with no other view than to raise a fortune
at the expense of the people. Whether the wretched
and defenceless condition in which the French found
our colonies at the beginning of this war, ought not to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
be ascribed chiefly to this cause, is a question I shall
wave at present. Because the evils we have already
suffered from former misconduct, will, I hope, be
now removed, by a total alteration of measures under
an able and honest administration.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that not one of the historians who
reproach the Carthaginians with corruption, were
ever able to accuse them of luxury and effeminacy.
The Carthaginians, to their immortal honour, stand
single upon the records of history, &#8220;the only people
in the universe, upon whom immense wealth was
never able to work its usual effects.&#8221; The Romans,
corrupted by wealth, quickly lost all pretensions both
to publick and private virtue, and from a race of
heroes, degenerated into a nation of the most abject
slaves. The Carthaginian virtue was so far from
degenerating that it shone brighter in the last period
of their history, than in any of the former. Even
the behaviour of their women in that long and brave
defence of their city against the whole Roman power,
equalled, or rather exceeded, that of the Roman
matrons in those times, when they were most celebrated
for publick virtue. When the Romans were
masters of the city, one small part only excepted,
and that part actually in flames, the generous wife
of Asdrubal the chief commander,<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> closed the scene
by as desperate an act of heroick bravery, as can be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
met with in history. After she had upbraided her
husband as a coward and a traitor for submitting to
Scipio, she declared her determined resolution of
dying free, and not surviving the fate of her country.
She first stabbed both her children, and threw them
into the flames; then leaped in after their bodies,
and buried herself in the ruins of Carthage.</p>

<p>The sententious Montesquieu remarks,<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> &#8220;that
when Carthage made war with her opulence against
the Roman poverty, her great disadvantage arose
from what she esteemed her greatest strength, and
on which she placed her chief dependence. The reason,
as he judiciously observes, is evident. Gold and
silver may be easily exhausted, but publick virtue,
constancy, and firmness of mind, fortitude and
poverty, are inexhaustible.&#8221; The Carthaginians in
their wars employed foreign mercenaries. The Roman
armies were composed of their own natives. A
defeat or two at sea obstructed the Carthaginian
commerce, and stopped the spring which supplied
their publick exchequer. The loss of a battle in
Africa, where their country was quite open, and destitute
of fortresses, and the natives as much strangers
to the use of arms as our own country people, reduced
them to submit to whatever terms the victors
thought proper to impose. Regulus, in the first
Punick war, cooped up the Carthaginians in their
capital, after he had given them one defeat by sea,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
and one by land. The Romans, after receiving four
successive defeats from Hannibal, the last of which
was the fatal battle of Cann&aelig;, where they lost most
of their best officers, and all their veteran troops,
would hearken to no terms of accommodation, and
even sent re-enforcements to Spain and other places,
though Hannibal was at their gates. The reason is
plain. The citizens of Carthage consisted chiefly of
unarmed, and undisciplined tradesmen. The citizens
of Rome, without distinction, composed a regular
body of disciplined militia.... A short comparison
between the Roman and Carthaginian polity, with
respect to the military of each people, will easily
point out to us the true cause which gave the
Romans their manifest superiority.</p>

<p>I have already taken notice of some capital defects
of the Carthaginians, both in their marine and military
departments. Montesquieu imputes several
capital errors to the Romans, but he attributes their
preservation after the defeat at Cann&aelig;, when they
were at the very brink of ruin, to the force of their
institution. He seems to place this force in the
superior wisdom and firmness of the Roman senate.
A short inquiry into their conduct, during the second
Punick war, will show that the cause of their preservation
at that time must be ascribed to a very different
principle, and that Montesquieu too hastily
adopted that opinion from the Greek and Roman
historians.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>If we examine the boasted behaviour of the Roman
senate, from the first attack of Saguntum to the
memorable battle of Cann&aelig;, we shall find it to consist
of one continued series of blunders, which carry all
the marks of weak, factious, and divided counsels.
The Romans had certain intelligence of Hannibal's
design of attacking them in Italy. This was no
secret in Spain, where every preparation, and every
motion of Hannibal&#8217;s was directed to that point of
view. The Romans were certainly jealous of such
a design, when they sent ambassadours to Hannibal,
to inform him, that if he passed the Iberus, and
attacked the Saguntines, they should look upon it as
a declaration of war. When they had received an
evasive answer from Hannibal, they crossed over to
Africa, and made the same declaration to the Carthaginian
senate. When Hannibal laid siege to Saguntum,
did the Romans act up to their formidable
declaration, or did they send a single man to the assistance
of those faithful allies? just the reverse;
they wasted nine months, the time the siege lasted,
in useless debates, and fruitless embassies. They
sacrificed that faithful and heroick people, together
with their own interest and character, by their folly
and irresolution.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> For if they had sent a powerful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
army at first, they might have saved Saguntum, or
at least confined the war to Spain, and prevented it
from penetrating into their own bowels. After Hannibal
had laid Saguntum in ashes, did the boasted
wisdom and firmness of the Roman senate appear in
more vigorous, or more politick measures? They
again employed a whole winter in a wise embassy to
Carthage, to just as little purpose as the former, and
gave Hannibal all the time he could wish to prepare
for his expedition. When Hannibal was on his
march for Italy, instead of shutting up the passages
of the Alps, which would easily have defeated that
daring enterprise, they ordered the consul Scipio,
with his army, to oppose his passage over the Rhone.
The consul came just in time enough to learn, that
such dilatory measures would never check the progress
of so active and vigilant an enemy, who had
already passed that river, and was on his march for
the Alps.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> The consul immediately re-embarked his
troops, and hastened to meet him in his descent from
those mountains. But Hannibal was already near
the banks of the Po, where the consul attacked him,
but was defeated and dangerously wounded. The
senate, alarmed at Hannibal&#8217;s passage over the Alps,
which they had taken no precaution to prevent, sent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
in a great fright for the other consul Sempronius,
with his army, out of Sicily. He arrived, and joined
his wounded colleague Scipio, who was an able officer,
and having learnt, by experience, how dangerous an
enemy they had to cope with, advised caution and
prudence in all their operations. But Sempronius,
vain, rash and ignorant, was deaf to all salutary
advice, which he ridiculed as the effect of fear.
Hannibal, who never inquired into the number of
his enemies, but studied only the foibles of their
commanders, directed all his operations upon that
principle. He applied therefore to the foible of Sempronius,
which he was soon master of, drew him
into a snare, and cut off almost his whole army. The
senate was dreadfully frighted at this second defeat;
but to mend the matter, they suffered Flaminius, a
man more vain, more headstrong, and more rash
than Sempronius, to be chosen consul, and sent
against Hannibal. As he acted upon the same principles,
he ran headlong into the trap laid for him by his
artful enemy, and lost his life together with his whole
army. Though this terrible blow threw the Romans
into inexpressible consternation, yet it seems to have
brought them to their senses. For they at last created
the celebrated Fabius dictator, who was the only
Roman commander capable of opposing Hannibal.
Yet even here they could not help giving another
instance of their folly, by forcing Minucius upon him
for his general of horse, a man of the same character
with Sempronius or Flaminius. Fabius acted upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
a quite different plan. He knew the danger and folly
of opposing new raised troops to veterans, flushed
with repeated victories, and commanded by so consummate
a general. He therefore opposed art to
art, watched every motion of his enemy, and cut off
his foragers. Hannibal, whose army was composed
chiefly of soldiers of fortune out of different nations,
connected to him by no other tie than the hopes of
plunder, and their esteem for his personal abilities,
was sensible, that such a conduct in his enemy would
quickly put an end to all his hopes in Italy. He
tried therefore every art he was master of to bring
Fabius to a battle; but the wary Roman convinced
him, that he knew his trade too well to deviate from
that plan, which alone could save his country.
Though Hannibal did justice to those fine strokes of
his antagonist, yet they were too delicate for the eyes
of the Romans. They were disgusted at his conduct,
because they wanted capacity to understand it, and
gave credit to the idle boasts of Minucius, though
they had already suffered so severely by trusting men
of his genius. Yet, by the most unaccountable folly,
they raised Minucius to an equality of power with
Fabius; and Rome, for the first time, saw two dictators
vested with unlimited authority. The wiser
Fabius, though amazed at the stupidity of his countrymen,
adhered steadily to his first plan. He gave up
half the army to the command of his new colleague,
but was determined to preserve the other moiety at
least, upon which so much depended. Hannibal was
sensible that the Romans could not have done him a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
more essential piece of service, unless they had recalled
Fabius. He immediately threw out a bait for
Minucius, which that rash, unthinking commander
as greedily bit at. He fell into the trap laid for him
by the crafty Hannibal; was enveloped by the Carthaginians,
and must inevitably have perished, with
all the troops under his command, if Fabius had not
flown to his assistance, repulsed the enemy, and rescued
him from the most imminent danger of death
or captivity. Though Fabius had been so ill used
by his countrymen in general, and by his colleague
Minucius in particular, yet he showed, by this generous
action, a greatness of soul superior to private
resentment, and every selfish passion, which he was
always ready to sacrifice to the publick welfare.
Minucius indeed felt the force of the obligation, as
well as of his own incapacity: he nobly acknowledged
it in the strongest terms, and returned to his former
post and duty to his abler commander. But this
heroick behaviour of Fabius seems to have made no
more impression upon his countrymen, than his masterly
conduct. Two new consuls were chosen, to
whom he resigned his authority and army, and retired
to Rome neglected and unemployed. The new
consuls followed the advice of Fabius, and avoided
coming to action, which distressed Hannibal extremely.
But the following year exhibits such a
masterpiece of folly and stupidity in that Roman
senate, whose firmness and wisdom are so much
boasted of by historians, and such infatuation in the
body of the Roman people as would seem incredible,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
if the facts, as handed down to us by their own
historians themselves, did not prove it beyond a
possibility of doubt or contradiction. Determined to
drive Hannibal out of Italy, and put a speedy end to
so ruinous a war, they raised one of the mightiest
armies they had ever yet brought into the field, and
employed in it every officer of note or distinction at
that time in Rome, the great Fabius alone excepted.
This was the last stake of the Romans, upon which
their all was ventured. But where does the boasted
wisdom of the senate appear in the management of
this affair, which was of the last importance? Of the
two consuls, Paulus &AElig;milius, the one, was a respectable
man, and an experienced officer: Terentius
Varro, the other, was a fellow of the lowest extraction,
who, by noise and impudence, had raised himself
to the tribuneship, was afterwards made pr&aelig;tor,
and, by the assistance of one Bebius, his relation, at
that time a tribune of the people, had forced himself
into the consular dignity. This wretch, who had
but just talents sufficient for a captain of the mob,
who had never seen an action (nor perhaps an army)
in his life, had the impudence to censure the conduct
of Fabius, and to boast in the senate, that he would
immediately drive Hannibal out of Italy. The wise
senate were not only so weak as to believe, but, in
opposition to all the remonstrances of Fabius, even
to trust such an empty coxcomb with an equal share
in the command. They even gave the consuls
orders to fight the enemy without delay, so great
was their confidence in the gasconading Varro. Hannibal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
at that time was so greatly distressed for want
of provisions, that his Spanish troops begun to mutiny,
and talked openly of revolting to the Romans,
and he himself had thoughts of retiring into Gaul for
his own personal safety. &AElig;milius, who endeavoured
in every point to follow the advice of Fabius, declined
fighting, and was convinced by his intelligence, that
Hannibal could not subsist his troops above ten days
longer. But Varro was alike deaf to reason or persuasion.
Debates at last run so high between the
consuls, that repeated expresses were sent to the
senate by &AElig;milius for fresh orders. Had the senate
acted with that prudence, which has been so loudly
celebrated by historians, they would certainly have
created Fabius dictator at that critical juncture,
which would have put an end to the differences and
authority of the consuls. For how could they reasonably
hope for success, whilst the army was commanded
by two generals, vested with equal power,
who differed as widely in opinion as in temper? But
their chief view at that time seems to have been to
mortify Fabius, and to that favourite point they wilfully
sacrificed the publick honour and safety.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
&AElig;milius at last returned to Rome, and laid the whole
affair before the senate. But Varro&#8217;s party proved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
the majority, and orders were renewed for fighting,
but not immediately. &AElig;milius still declined fighting,
and followed the advice of Fabius, but the alternate
command of the two consuls, which took place
every day, defeated all his measures. Varro, on the
day of his command, marched the army so close to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
the enemy, that it was impossible to retire without
fighting. This imprudent step brought on the famous
battle of Cann&aelig;, where Hannibal, whose whole force
scarce equalled the moiety of the Romans, gave them
the most remarkable defeat we ever read of in their
history. Polybius, and after him the rest of the
historians, impute this defeat to the great superiority
of the Carthaginian army in horse, and the ignorance
of Varro in pitching upon a plain open country for
the field of battle, where Hannibal could employ his
cavalry to the best advantage. That the Carthaginian
horse was superior to the Roman in goodness,
is readily admitted. But if we compute the number
of the cavalry of the Romans, and that of their allies,
as given us by Polybius himself, we shall find the
difference in each army amounted but to four thousand;
so small an advantage therefore, in point of
number, could never possibly have turned the scale
in favour of Hannibal when the Romans had such
prodigious odds in the number of their infantry, who
showed themselves no way inferior to Hannibal's
foot, either in bravery or intrepidity. The true
reason was, the infinite superiority of Hannibal in
point of generalship. That consummate leader, by
a most exquisite disposition of his troops, a <i>man&oelig;uvre</i>
much too fine for the eyes of the Roman generals,
caught their whole infantry fairly in a trap (though
in a plain level country) where they were almost to a
man cut to pieces, or taken. &AElig;milius, and all the
other general officers, with seventy thousand Romans,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
lay dead upon the field of battle after a brave and
obstinate resistance.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> The infamous Varro, that
base minded fellow, as Polybius terms him,<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> who
commanded the cavalry of the allies on the left wing,
behaved like a true bully in the face of danger. He
fled almost at the first attack, and rather chose to live
with infamy than die with honour. When the fatal
news reached the city of Rome, both senate and
people gave up all hopes of safety. Fabius alone
took the lead, and acted with his usual firmness and
calmness upon this occasion. He placed guards at
the gates to prevent the desertion of the citizens, who
were flying in great numbers to escape the conquerors,
whom they expected every moment. He
confined the women to their houses, who had filled
the city with lamentations. He manned the walls
and outworks, and took every other precaution which
the shortness of the time would admit of. All resigned
themselves implicitly to his conduct, and he
acted for the time as sole governor. Many of the
senators, and principal of the Roman nobility, were
in actual consultation about leaving Italy, and retiring
elsewhere for safety. But they were prevented, as
Livy informs us, by the terrible threats of young
Scipio, and compelled to stay and share the fate of
their country.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> Hannibal has been greatly censured
for not attacking Rome itself immediately after the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
battle, and is accused of not knowing how to make
the proper use of a victory, though he knew so well
how to conquer. The candid Montesquieu acquits
him of this charge. His reasons are, that though
Rome at that time was in the highest degree of consternation,
yet the effects of fear upon a warlike
people, inured to arms like the Romans, and a low
undisciplined rabble, who are strangers to the use of
arms, are very different. In the former, who are
conscious of their own strength, it almost always
changes into the most desperate courage. In the
latter, who feel their own weakness too sensibly, it
dispirits so much as to render them incapable of resistance.
Hence he gives it as his real opinion, that
Hannibal would have failed of success if he had undertaken
the siege of that city. His proof is, because
the Romans at that very time were able to send sufficient
succours, drawn from their own citizens, to
every part where they were then wanted. Thus
Rome was saved, not by the wisdom or firmness of
the senate, but the prudence and magnanimity of
one old officer, whom they despised and hated, and
the intrepidity of a boy of eighteen, joined, as I observed
before from Dionysius, to the force of that
part of their institution, which formed the whole
body of their citizens into a militia, ever ready, and
capable of taking the field as soldiers. All the Roman
armies, which were opposed to Hannibal, were
drawn out of this militia. Nor do we meet with one
instance of cowardice, or ill-behaviour amongst the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
men, but rather of intrepidity even to rashness,
which used to be the characteristick of the British
nation. Polybius, who was at least as able a judge
of the military as any man of that age, and who lived
very near the time of the Hannibalick war (as he
terms it) is loud in his praises of the Roman troops,
whose infantry he prefers greatly to the Carthaginian
mercenaries.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> Nor does he once impute any of their
defeats to the fault of their men, but invariably to
the folly and incapacity of their commanders.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the great defect in the Carthaginian
military institution consisted in the want of a
national militia, which, as Polybius observes, was
the reason of their employing foreign mercenaries.
The capital defects in the Romans lay in that equality
of power with which each consul was vested in the
field, and the short duration of their command, as
their office was only annual. Every battle which
the Romans lost to Hannibal except the first, may
be fairly ascribed to the former of these causes.
The defeats of Trebia and Thrasymene were plainly
occasioned by the jealousy of one of the consuls, lest
the other should share with him in the glory of
beating Hannibal; as the want of harmony, and difference
of opinion between the two consuls, was the
primary cause of the dreadful defeat at Cann&aelig;. To
the latter cause we may justly attribute the long
duration of the Hannibalick war. When the great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
man, who entered Italy with no more than twenty
thousand foot and six thousand horse, maintained his
ground above sixteen years, without any assistance
from Carthage, against the whole united force and
efforts of the Romans, by the mere strength of his
own extraordinary genius. For as every man, who
had interest sufficient to obtain the consulship, was
immediately vested with the command of an army,
however qualified or not, so he was obliged to resign
his command at the end of the year, before he had
well time to be thoroughly acquainted with the true
method of dealing with his enemy. Thus every
new successive commander, amongst the Romans,
had the same task to begin afresh at the opening of
every campaign. I know that political writers
ascribe this mistaken policy to that jealousy, and
fear of lodging so much power in so few hands for
any length of time, which is so natural to all republican
governments. And that the office of dictator
was contrived as a remedy against any abuse, or
inconveniency, which might at any time arise from
the consular power. But the event showed, that the
remedy was much worse than the disease. Whilst
publick virtue existed, the office of dictator was
frequently useful. But when luxury had introduced
corruption, the <i>pro tempore</i> dictator soon came to
be perpetual, and the perpetual dictator terminated
in a perpetual and despotick emperor.</p>

<p>At Carthage their military institution was entirely
different. The power of the generals in the field
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
was absolute and unlimited; and, if their conduct
was approved of, generally continued to the end of
whatever war they were engaged in. They had no
occasion for the dangerous resource of a dictator.
The watchful eye of their standing court-martial,
the committee of one hundred and four of their
ablest senators, was a perpetual, and never-failing
check upon their ambition, or ill behavior of their
generals.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> The sacred cohort amongst the Carthaginians,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
consisted of a large body of volunteers of
the richest and greatest families of the nation. This
wise and noble institution was one of the chief supports
of the Carthaginian state; and as it was the
constant seminary of their officers and commanders,
might very probably be one cause why luxury and
effeminacy could never obtain footing in that warlike
republick. For we always find this generous body
giving the most signal instances of bravery and conduct,<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a>
and bearing down all before them.... Nor did
they ever quit the field of battle, until they were
deserted by the rest of the army, and even then generally
retired in excellent order.</p>

<p>The Romans were gradually trained up, from the
very infancy of their republick, in long and obstinate
wars with their Italian neighbours, who were masters
of the same arms and disciplines, and were no way
their inferiors in bravery. Nor did they perfect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
themselves in the art of war, until they learned it by
bloody experience from Pyrrhus, the most consummate
captain of that age. The Carthaginians
were only exercised in war with the wild undisciplined
Africans, or the irregular Spaniards, nor
were they able with their numerous fleets and prodigious
armies to complete the reduction of that part
of Sicily, which was inhabited by Grecian colonies,
who retained their native arms and discipline. Hence
arose the great superiority of the Romans, both in
soldiers and commanders. Though the Barcan family
produced some great officers, who at least equalled
the ablest generals Rome could ever boast of.</p>

<p>It is evident from the course of this inquiry, that
the ruin of the Roman republick arose wholly from
internal causes. The ruin of Carthage was owing
remotely to internal, but immediately to external.
The Plebeian faction reduced Rome to the verge of
ruin at the battle of Cann&aelig;, and a complication of
factions completed the subversion of that republick
under the two triumvirates. The envy and jealousy
of the Hannonian faction deprived Carthage of all
the fruits of Hannibal&#8217;s amazing victories and progress,
and paved the way for the utter excision of
their very name and nation by the Roman arms.
Such are the direful effects of faction, when suffered
to run its natural lengths without control, in
the most flourishing and best constituted government!...</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />

<small>OF REVOLUTIONS IN MIXED GOVERNMENTS.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Polybius</span> remarks,<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> that the best form of government
is that which is composed of a due admixture
of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy. He
affirms that his assertion may not only be proved
from reason, but from the evidence of fact, and cites
the Spartan constitution in proof, which was modelled
upon that very plan by Lycurgus. He adds
too, that to perpetuate the duration of his government,<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a>
he united the peculiar excellencies of all
the best governments in one form, that neither of
the three parts, by swelling beyond its just bounds,
might ever be able to deviate into its original inborn
defects: but that whilst each power was mutually
drawn back by the opposite attraction of the other
two, neither power might ever preponderate, but
the balance of government continue suspended in its
true &aelig;quipoise.</p>

<p>From the observance of this nice adjustment of
the balance of government, he foretells the duration
or fall of all mixed governments in general. He
adds, that as all government arises originally from
the people; so all mutations in government proceed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
primarily from the people also. For when
once a state has struggled through many and great
difficulties, and emerged at last to freedom and
wealth, men begin to sink gradually into luxury,
and to grow more dissolute in their morals. The
seeds of ambition will spring up, and prompt them
to be more fond of contending for superiority in the
magistracy, and carrying their point, in whatever
they had set their hearts upon, than is consistent
with the welfare of the community: when once
these evils are got to a head in a country so circumstanced,
the change must necessarily be for the
worse; because the principle of such change will
rise from the gratification, or disappointment of the
ambition of the chief citizens, with respect to honours
and preferments; and from that insolence and
luxury arising from wealth, by which the morals of
the private people will be totally corrupted. Thus
the change in government will be primarily effected by
the people. For when the people are galled by
the rapine and oppression of those in power, arising
from a principle of avarice; and corrupted, and
elated with an undue opinion of their own weight,
by the flatteries of the disappointed, which proceed
from a principle of ambition, they raise those furious
commotions in the state, which unhinge all government.
These commotions first reduce it to a
state of anarchy, which at last terminates in absolute
monarchy and tyranny.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>

<p>I have here given the sentiments of Polybius (and
almost in his own words) from that excellent dissertation
on government, preserved to us in the sixth
book of his history, which I would recommend to the
perusal of my countrymen. He there traces government
up to its first origin. He explains the principles,
by which different governments arose to the
summit of their power and grandeur, and proves,
that they sunk to ruin by a more or less rapid progress,
in proportion as they receded more or less
from the first principles on which they were originally
founded. He survived the ruin of all the Grecian
republicks, as well as Carthage, and lived (as he
more than once tells us) to see the Romans masters
of the known world. Blest with parts and learning
superior to most men of his time, joined to the most
solid judgment, and the experience of eighty-two
years; no man better understood the intrinsick nature
of government in general. No man could with
more certainty foretel the various mutations, which
so frequently happen in different forms of government,
which must be ever in a fluctuating state, from
the complicated variety of the human passions.
Nor can any man give us better hints, than he has
done, for guarding against the effects of those dangerous
passions, and preserving the constitution of a
free people in its full force and vigour. Of all the
legislators (which he knew of) he prefers Lycurgus,
whom he looks upon rather as divinely inspired, than
as a mere man. He esteems the plan of government,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
which he established at Sparta, the most perfect, and
proposes it as a general model worthy the imitation
of every other community; and he remarks, that
the Spartans, by adhering to that plan, preserved
their liberty longer than any other nation of the
known world.</p>

<p>I cannot help observing upon this occasion, that
our own constitution as settled at the revolution, so
nearly coincides with Lycurgus&#8217;s general plan of
government (as laid down by Polybius) where the
monarchy was for life, and hereditary, that it seems,
at first sight, to have been formed by that very
model. For our plan of government intended to fix
and preserve so just a proportion of the monarchick,
aristocratick, and democratick powers, by their representatives,
king, lords, and commons; that any
two of those powers might be able jointly to give a
check to the other, but not to destroy it, as the destruction
of any one power must necessarily induce a
different form of government. This is the true
basis of the British constitution, the duration of which
must absolutely depend upon the just equilibrium
preserved between these three powers. This consequently
is the unerring test, by which every unbiassed
and attentive considerer may judge, whether we are
in an improving state, or whether, and by what degrees,
we are verging towards ruin. But as I aim at
reformation not satire; as I mean no invidious reflections,
but only to give my sentiments with that
honest freedom, to which every Briton is entitled by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
birthright, I shall just state from Polybius, the
means by which all mixed governments have originally
deviated from those first principles, which were
the basis of their rise and grandeur: how by this
deviation they tended towards their decline, and that
those means acquiring additional force from that
very decline, necessarily produced those evils, which
accelerated the destruction of every free people.
As the remarks of this most judicious historian, are
founded upon long experience, drawn from undeniable
facts, to many of which he himself was eyewitness,<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a>
they will not only carry greater weight, but
will enable us to form a right judgment of our own
situation, as it is at present circumstanced.</p>

<p>Polybius observes, that of all the mixed governments
ever known to him, that of Lycurgus alone
was the result of cool reason and long study. The
form of the Roman republick, on the contrary, was
the production of necessity. For the Romans came
at the knowledge of the most proper remedies for all
their political evils, not by dint of reasoning, but by
the deep felt experience of the many and dangerous
calamities, with which they had so long and so often
struggled. I do not in the least doubt, but that excellent
form of government established by our rude
Gothick ancestors, wherever their arms prevailed,
arose from the same cause, necessity founded upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
experience. Every mixed government therefore,
where the three powers are duly balanced, has a
<i>resource</i> within itself against all those political evils
to which it is liable. By this <i>resource</i>, I mean, that
joint coercive force, which any two of these powers
are able to exercise over the other. But as nothing
but necessity can authorize the exercise of this
power, so it must be strictly regulated by those principles,
on which the government was founded. For
if by an undue exercise of this power, any one of the
three should be diminished, or annihilated, the balance
would be destroyed, and the constitution alter proportionally
for the worse. Thus in Denmark, where
the monarchy was limited and elective, the people,
exasperated by the oppressions of the nobility, who
had assumed an almost despotick power, out of a
principle of revenge threw their whole weight into
the regal scale. Frederick the third, (the then
reigning monarch) strengthened by this accession of
power and the assistance of the people, compelled
the nobility to surrender their power and privileges.
In consequence of this fatal step taken by the people,
the monarchy, in the year 1660, became absolute and
hereditary. Lord Molesworth observes upon this
occasion, in his account of Denmark, that the people
of Denmark have since felt by sad experience, that
the little finger of an absolute prince is heavier than
the loins of a hundred nobles.</p>

<p>The late revolution of government in Sweden,
though arising from the same principles, took a very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
different turn. Charles the twelfth, brave even to
enthusiasm, and as insatiably fond of glory as the
ambitious Alexander, had quite tired out and exhausted
his people, by his destructive expeditions.
But when that fortunate shot from the town of Frederickshal
gave repose to his own country as well as
to a great part of Europe, the states of Sweden, no
longer awed by a warlike monarch (who had usurped
a despotick power) and a veteran army, again resumed
the exercise of their own inherent powers.
Stimulated by a desire of vengeance for the evils
they had already suffered, and the fear of smarting
again under the same evils, they beheaded Gortz, the
minister of their late monarch&#8217;s oppressions, and left
the crown no more than the bare shadow of authority.
For though they continued the monarchy for life
and hereditary, yet they imposed such rigid terms
upon their succeeding kings, as reduced them to a
state of dependance and impotence nearly equal to a
doge of Genoa or Venice. We see, in both these
instances, the revolution in government effected by
the union of two powers of the government against
the third. The catastrophe indeed in both nations
was different, because that third power which was
obnoxious to the other two, was different in each
nation. In the former of these instances, the people,
fired with resentment against the nobility, and
instigated by secret emissaries of the crown, blindly
gave up their whole power to the king, which
enabled him to deprive the nobility (the second estate)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
of their share of power, and bring the whole to centre
in the crown. Thus the government in Denmark
was changed into absolute monarchy. In the latter,
the senate took the lead during the <i>interregnum</i>,
which followed the death of Charles, and changed
the government into aristocracy. For though the
outward form of government indeed is preserved,
yet the essence no longer remains. The monarchy
is merely titular, but the whole power is absorbed
by the senate, consequently the government is strictly
aristocratick. For the people were by no means
gainers by the change, but remain in the same state
of servitude, which they so much complained of before.
Thus in all revolutions in mixed governments,
where the union of two injured powers is animated
by the spirit of patriotism, and directed by
that salutary rule before laid down, which forbids us
to destroy, and only enjoins us to reduce the third
offending power within its proper bounds, the balance
of government will be restored upon its first principles,
and the change will be for the better. Thus
when the arbitrary and insupportable encroachments
of the crown under James the second, aimed so visibly
at the subversion of our constitution, and the introduction
of absolute monarchy; necessity authorized
the lords and commons (the other two powers)
to have <i>recourse</i> to the joint exercise of that restraining
power, which is the inherent <i>resource</i> of all
mixed governments. But as the exercise of this
power was conducted by patriotism, and regulated
by the above-mentioned rule, the event was the late
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
happy revolution; by which the power of the crown
was restrained within its proper limits, and the government
resettled upon its true basis, as nearly as
the genius of the times would admit of. But if the
passions prevail, and ambition lurks beneath the mask
of patriotism, the change will inevitably be for the
worse. Because the restitution of the balance of
government, which alone can authorize the exercise
of the two joint powers against the third, will be only
the pretext, whilst the whole weight and fury of the
incensed people will be directed solely to the ends of
ambition. Thus if the regal power should be enabled
to take the lead by gaining over the whole weight of
the people, the change will terminate in absolute
monarchy; which so lately happened in Denmark,
as it had happened before in almost all the old Gothick
governments. If the aristocratick power, actuated
by that ambition, which (an extreme few instances
excepted) seems inseparable from the regal, should
be able to direct the joint force of the people against
the crown, the change will be to an aristocratick government,
like the present state of Sweden, or the
government of Holland, from the death of William
the third, to the late revolution in favour of the
stadtholder. If the power of the people impelled to
action by any cause, either real or imaginary, should
be able to subvert the other two, the consequence
will be, that anarchy, which Polybius terms, the ferine
and savage dominion of the people.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> This will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
continue until some able and daring spirit, whose low
birth or fortune precluded him from rising to the
chief dignities of the state by any other means, puts
himself at the head of the populace inured to live
by plunder and rapine, and drawing the whole power
to himself, erects a tyranny upon the ruins of the
former government; or until the community, tired
out and impatient under their distracted situation,
bring back the government into its old channel. This
is what Polybius terms the circumvolution of governments;<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a>
or the rotation of governments within themselves
until they return to the same point. The fate
of the Grecian and Roman republicks terminated
in the former of these events. The distracted state
of government in this nation, from 1648, to the restoration
of Charles the second, ended happily in the
latter, though the nation for some years experienced
the former of these catastrophes under the government
of Cromwell.</p>

<p>I have here given a short, but plain general
analysis of government, founded upon experience
drawn from historical truths, and adapted to the
general capacity of my countrymen. But if any one
desires to be acquainted with the philosophy of government,
and to investigate the ratio and series of
all these mutations, or revolutions of governments
within themselves, I must (with Polybius) refer him
to Plato&#8217;s republick.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p>

<p>The plan of a good and happy government, which
Plato lays down, by the mouth of Socrates, in the
former part of that work, is wholly ideal, and impossible
to be executed, unless mankind could be
new moulded. But the various revolutions of government
(described above) which he treats of in the
latter part, was founded upon facts, facts which he
himself had been eyewitness to in the numerous
republicks of Greece and Sicily, and had fatally experienced
in his own country Athens. The divine
philosopher, in that part of his admirable treatise,
traces all these mutations up to their first source,
&#8220;the intemperance of the human passions,&#8221; and
accounts for their various progress, effects and consequences,
from the various combinations of the
same perpetually conflicting passions. His maxims
are founded solely upon the sublimest truths, his
allusions beautiful and apposite, and his instructions
alike applicable to publick or private life, equally
capable of forming the statesman or the man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />

<small>OF THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Xenophon</span> observes,<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> that if the Athenians, together
with the sovereignty of the seas, had enjoyed
the advantageous situation of an island, they might
with great ease have given law to their neighbours.
For the same fleets which enabled them to ravage
the seacoasts of the continent at discretion, could
equally have protected their own country from the
insults of their enemies as long as they maintained
their naval superiority. One would imagine, says
the great Montesquieu,<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> that Xenophon in this passage
was speaking of the island of Britain. The
judicious and glorious exertion of our naval force
under the present ministry, so strongly confirms
Xenophon&#8217;s remark, that one would imagine their
measures were directed, as well as dictated, by his
consummate genius. We are masters both of those
natural and acquired advantages, which Xenophon
required to make his countrymen invincible. We
daily feel their importance more and more, and must
be sensible that our liberty, our happiness, and our
very existence as a people, depend upon our naval
superiority supported by our military virtue and
publick spirit. Nothing, humanly speaking, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
luxury, effeminacy and corruption, can ever deprive
us of this envied superiority. What an accumulated
load of guilt therefore must lie upon any future
administration, who, to serve the ends of faction,
should ever precipitate Britain from her present
height down to the abject state of Athens, by encouraging
those evils to blast all publick virtue in their
unlimited progress.</p>

<p>As Britain is so confessedly superior to all the
maritime powers of the ancients by the advantages
of situation; so the British constitution, as settled
at the revolution, is demonstrably far preferable
to, and better formed for duration, than any of
the most celebrated republicks of antiquity. As
the executive power is vested in a single person,
who is deemed the first branch in the legislature;
and as that power is for life and hereditary; our
constitution is neither liable to those frequent convulsions,
which attended the annual elections of consuls,
nor to that solecism in politicks, two supreme
heads of one body for life, and hereditary, which
was the great defect in the Spartan institution. As
the house of commons, elected by, and out of the
body of the people, is vested with all the power
annexed to the tribunitial office amongst the Romans;
the people enjoy every advantage which ever accrued
to the Roman people by that institution, whilst the
nation is secure from all those calamitous seditions,
in which every factious tribune could involve his
country at pleasure. And as all our questions in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
parliament are decided by a majority of voices; we
can never be subject to that capital defect in the
Carthaginian constitution, where the single <i>veto</i>, of
one discontented senator, referred the decision of the
most important affair to a wrong-headed, ungovernable
populace. The house of peers is placed in
the middle of the balance, to prevent the regal scale
from preponderating to despotism or tyranny; or
the democratical to anarchy and its consequences.
The equitable intent of our laws is plainly calculated,
like those of Solon, to preserve the liberty and property
of every individual in the community; and to
restrain alike the richest or the poorest, the greatest
or the meanest, from doing or suffering wrong from
each other. This is the wise and salutary plan of
power established at the revolution. Would we
always adhere steadily to this plan, and preserve the
just &aelig;quilibrium, as delivered down to us by our
great ancestors, our constitution would remain firm
and unshaken to the end of time.</p>

<p>I have already showed in the course of these
papers that, since that ever memorable &aelig;ra, we suffered
some breaches to be made in the most interesting
part of this constitution, not by the hand of
open violence, but by the insidious, and consequently
more dangerous arts of corruption. The great
increase in our commerce after the peace of Utrecht,
brought in a vast accession of wealth; and that
wealth revived, and gradually diffused that luxury
through the whole nation, which had lain dormant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
during the dangerous reign of James the second, and
the warlike reigns of William and Ann. To this
universal luxury, and this only, we must impute
that amazing progress of corruption, which seized
the very vitals of our constitution. If therefore we
impartially compare the present state of our own
country with that of Rome and Carthage, we shall
find, that we resemble them most when in their
declining period.</p>

<p>To the commercial maxims of the Carthaginians,
we have added their insatiable lust of gain, without
their economy, and contempt of luxury and
effeminacy. To the luxury and dissipation of the
Romans, we have joined their venality, without their
military spirit: and we feel the pernicious effects of
the same species of faction, which was the great
leading cause to ruin in both those republicks. The
Roman institution was formed to make and to preserve
their conquests. Abroad invincible, at home
invulnerable, they possessed all the resources requisite
for a warlike nation within themselves. The
military spirit of their people, where every citizen
was a soldier, furnished inexhaustible supplies for
their armies abroad, and secured them at home from
all attempts of invasion. The Carthaginian was
better calculated to acquire than to preserve. They
depended upon commerce for the acquisition of
wealth, and upon their wealth for the protection of
their commerce. They owed their conquests to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
venal blood and sinews of other people, and, like
their ancestors the Ph&oelig;nicians, exhibited their money-bags
as symbols of their power. They trusted too
much to the valour of foreigners, and too little to
that of their own natives. Thus whilst they were
formidable abroad by their fleets and mercenary
armies, they were weak and defenceless at home.
But the event showed, how dangerous it is for the
greatest commercial nation to rely on this kind of
mercantile policy; and that a nation of unarmed
undisciplined traders can never be a match, whilst
they are so circumstanced, for a nation of soldiers.
About two centuries ago a handful (comparatively
speaking) of rude irregular Tartars subdued, and still
enjoy the dominion of China, the most populous,
and the richest commercial empire in the universe.
And a neighbouring mercantile republick, by adhering
too closely to these maxims, is at this time
neither respected by her friends, nor feared by her
enemies.</p>

<p>The English constitution was originally military,
like that of every kingdom founded by our Gothick
ancestors. Henry the seventh gave the first spur
to commerce by diffusing property more equally
amongst the commons at the expense of the nobility.
From that time, the ancient military spirit of this
nation has gradually dwindled to the low ebb, at
which we now find it. But the great epocha of our
marine, as well as commerce, ought properly to be
fixed to the glorious reign of Elizabeth. The colonies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
settled during the peaceful reign of James the
first, laid the foundation of our present extensive
commerce. The civil wars between Charles the
first and the parliament, revived and diffused the
ancient military spirit through the whole body of the
people; and the able Cromwell made the English
name more respectable in Europe, than it ever had
been under any of our monarchs. Our naval glory
seems to have reached its summit under that period;
for though our marine is greatly increased both in
the number and strength of our shipping, yet we
have by no means surpassed the commanders and
seamen of that time either in bravery or ability. The
reason is evident. Publick virtue then existed in its
full force, and zeal for the national glory was the
great spur to action. The commanders sailed in
quest of honour, not lucre, and esteemed the glory
of the capture as an adequate reward for the most
hazardous enterprises. Luxury was as much unknown
to the highest class, as spirituous liquors were to the
lowest. Discipline, sobriety, and an awful sense of
religion, were strictly kept up amongst the private
seamen; whilst the humane usage of the officers
taught them to obey from love, and a just sense of
their duty, not from the slavish principle of fear only.
The immortal Blake esteemed five hundred pounds
for a ring, and the publick thanks of parliament, a
glorious recompense for all those illustrious actions,
which made Africa and Europe tremble, and raised
the English flag to the summit of glory. Inferior
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
merit, in later times, has been rewarded with coronets
and great lucrative employments.</p>

<p>Luxury with its fatal effects was imported by
Charles the second at the restoration. The contagious
influence of that bane to publick virtue and
liberty, corrupted our manners, enervated our bodies,
and debased our minds, whilst our military spirit
subsided, in proportion as the love of pleasure increased.
Charles the second nurtured in the high
principles of prerogative, was diffident of a militia
composed of the whole body of the people. He
obtained a standing force of about four or five thousand
men under the specious denomination of guards
and garrisons; which he increased afterwards to
eight thousand, and suffered the militia gradually to
decay, until it became almost useless. A policy
fatal to liberty, which has been too successfully
copied, since that reign, by every iniquitous minister,
who support himself by faction. James the second,
devoted to bigotry, and influenced by the most weak,
as well as the most wicked counsels, that ever prevailed
in this kingdom, at one stroke disarmed the
people, and established a large standing army. As
the militia were unwilling to act against Monmouth
and his followers, whom they looked upon as the
protectors of their religion and liberties, James, concealing
the true reason, declared to his parliament,
that he had found the militia useless and unserviceable
by experience, and insisted upon such supplies,
as would enable him to support those additional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
troops, which he should find necessary for his security.
And he had actually increased his army to
thirty thousand men at the time of the revolution.
The whole reigns of William the third and Ann are
distinguished by war abroad and factions at home.
Yet though we entered into both those wars as principals,
the military spirit of our people was not much
improved; our national troops composed by a small
part of the allied armies, and we placed our chief
dependance upon foreign mercenaries.</p>

<p>Frequent attempts have been made since that time
to revive a national disciplined militia, which have
been as constantly defeated by corruption and the
malignity of faction. Our late fears of an invasion,
and the introduction of so large a body of foreign
troops, a measure highly unpopular and distasteful,
procured at last the long wished for act for a militia.
Mutilated as it was, and clogged with almost insuperable
difficulties by the same faction, who durst no
openly oppose it at that dangerous juncture, the real
well-wishers to their country were glad to accept it.
They looked upon it as a foundation laid for a much
more useful and extensive militia; which time and
opportunity might enable them to perfect. Much
has been said, and many assertions boldly thrown out
of the utter impracticability of a national militia.
But this is either the language of corruption or of
effeminacy and cowardice. The Romans, in the
first Punick war, found themselves unable to contend
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
with the Carthaginians for want of a marine. Yet
that magnanimous people, without any other knowledge
of the mechanism of a ship, than what they
acquired from a galley of their enemies, thrown by
accident upon their coasts, without either shipwright
or seamen, built, manned, and fitted out a fleet under
the consul Duilius, in three months time, which
engaged and totally defeated the grand fleet of Carthage,
though that republick had enjoyed the sovereignty
of the sea unrivaled for time immemorial.
This effort of the Roman magnanimity gives a higher
idea of the Roman genius, than any other action
recorded in their history. And by this alone we
must be convinced, &#8220;that nothing is insurmountable
to the unconquerable hand of liberty, when backed
by publick virtue, and the generous resolution of a
brave and willing people.&#8221; The difficulties and
obstacles in either case, I mean of making a fleet or
establishing a good militia, will admit of no comparison.
The Romans may almost be said to have
created a fleet out of nothing. We have nothing
more to do than to rouse and diffuse that martial
spirit through the nation, which the arts of ministerial
policy have so long endeavoured to keep dormant.
Great indeed has been the outcry of the danger
of trusting arms in the dissolute hands of the
scum and refuse of the nation in these licentious
times. These I consign to the proper severity of
the martial discipline of an army; for of this kind
of people, the bulk of every army in Europe is at
this time composed. I speak to the nobility and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
gentry, the traders and yeomanry of this kingdom, to
all those who are possessed of property, and have
something to lose, and from the interest of their
respective shares, are equally concerned in the
preservation of the whole. Of such as these the
Roman armies were composed who conquered Italy.
Every Roman soldier was a citizen possessed of property,
and equally interested in the safety of the
republick. The wisdom of the Romans in the choice
of their soldiers never appeared in so conspicuous a
light as after the defeat at Cann&aelig;. Every citizen
pressed to take up arms in defence of his country,
and not only refused his pay, but generously gave
up what gold and silver he was master of, even to the
most trifling ornaments, for the publick service. The
behaviour of the women too, to their immortal
honour, was equally great and disinterested. Such is
the spirit, which a truly brave and free people will
ever exert in a time of distress and danger. Marius
was the first man who broke through that wise
maxim, and raised his forces out of the sixth class,
which consisted only of the dregs and refuse of the
people. Marius too gave the first stab to the constitution
of his country. People of property are not
only the chief support, but the best and safest defence
of a free and opulent country; and their example
will always have a proper influence upon their inferiors.</p>

<p>Nothing but an extensive militia can revive the
once martial spirit of this nation, and we had even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
better once more be a nation of soldiers, like our
renowned ancestors, than a nation of abject crouching
slaves to the most rapacious, and most insolent
people in the universe. Let us not be too much
elated, and lulled into a fatal security from some late
successes, in which our national forces had no share.
Nothing is so common as unexpected vicissitudes in
war. Our enemies have many and great resources;
our heroick ally, in case of a reverse of fortune, few
or none. Our haughty and implacable enemy, unaccustomed
to insults in their own territories, will think
the blot in their honour indelible, until they have
returned the affront upon our coasts with redoubled
vengeance. Whilst a pretender to this crown exists,
France will never want a plausible pretext for invading
this kingdom. Their last attempt answered the
proposed end so well, that we may be certain, so
politick an enemy, instigated by revenge, will omit
no opportunity of playing the same successful engine
once more against us. The French are now perfectly
well acquainted with our weak side. The violent
shock our national credit received by the inroad of a
few Highlanders only, into the heart of this country,
has taught them the infallible method of distressing
us in that essential point. Should therefore our
measures for annoying that nation be ever so wisely
planned, yet we can never hope to execute them with
proportionate vigour, whilst we remain defenceless
at home. If the bare alarm only of an invasion
frightened us so lately into the expense, as well as
ignominy, of importing foreign mercenaries for our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
own defence, the French know by experience, that
an actual attempt would compel us to recall our fleets
and forces, and again expose our commerce, colonies,
and our only ally to their mercy. No man, I believe,
is so weak as to imagine, that France will be deterred
from such an attempt by the danger which may
attend it. For if we reflect upon the number of her
troops, the risk of ten or twenty thousand men, can
hardly be deemed an object worthy the attention of
so formidable a power. For should they all perish
in the attempt, yet France would be amply repaid by
the advantages she would draw from that confusion,
which they would necessarily occasion. The traitor
who lately pointed out the proper time, as well as
place for an invasion, and the fatal effects it would
have upon publick credit, whatever success might
attend it, furnishes us with a convincing proof, that
France never loses sight of so useful a measure. A
consideration which greatly enforces the necessity
of national union, and a national militia. The unequalled
abilities of one man<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> (humanly speaking)
have given a turn to the affairs of Germany, as
happy, as it was amazing; and hope begins to dawn
upon our late despairing nation. The wise and
vigorous measures of our present patriot-ministry
have conciliated not only the esteem, but the universal
confidence of the people. Under the present
ministry we laid the foundation of this long wished
for, though long despaired of, militia. If we support
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
their administration with unanimity and vigour, we
may fix this great national object, upon that extensive
and useful plan, which was designed and hoped for
by every lover of his country. The fate therefore of
the militia depends absolutely upon the present
crisis. For if we supinely neglect this auspicious
opportunity, future efforts will be just as ineffectual,
as the point we have already carried with so much
labour and assiduity. For the same function, which
has invariably opposed every attempt for a national
militia, are avowed enemies to the present ministers,
from that antipathy, which private interest and the
lust of power for selfish ends, will ever bear to patriotism
and publick virtue. Should therefore the evil
genius of this nation again prevail, and the same
faction once more seize the helm of government, we
must give up all hopes of a militia as well as every
other national measure.</p>

<p>Let us throw but one glance upon the present
situation of these once glorious republicks, and we
cannot help reflecting upon the final and direful catastrophe,
which will eternally result from the prevalence
of ambitious and selfish faction supported by
corruption.</p>

<p>Greece, once the nurse of arts and sciences, the
fruitful mother of philosophers, lawgivers and heroes,
now lies prostrate under the iron yoke of ignorance
and barbarism ... Carthage, once the mighty sovereign
of the ocean, and the centre of universal commerce,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
which poured the riches of the nations into
her lap, now puzzles the inquisitive traveller in his
researches after even the vestiges of her ruins....
And Rome, the mistress of the universe, which once
contained whatever was esteemed great or brilliant
in human nature, is now sunk into the ignoble seat
of whatever is esteemed mean and infamous.</p>

<p>Should faction again predominate and succeed in
its destructive views, and the dastardly maxims of
luxury and effeminancy universally prevail amongst
us ... such too will soon be the fate of Britain.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">25</span></a> Something seems plainly to be wanting in this passage,
which is strangely obscure and intricate. It is evident that
Agis employed his uncle Agesilaus to persuade his mother,
who was Agesilaus&#8217;s sister, &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#956;&#951;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#945; &#960;&#949;&#8055;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#957;, &#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#8052;&#957; &#959;&#8022;&#963;&#945;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7944;&#947;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#8049;&#959;&#965;. The king himself entreats his mother to assist him,
&amp;c. &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#8001; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8058;&#962; &#7952;&#948;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#959; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#956;&#951;&#964;&#961;&#8057;&#962;. And after he has enumerated
the advantages which would result from his scheme, Plutarch
abruptly adds &#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#8051;&#960;&#949;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#947;&#957;&#8061;&#956;&#945;&#953;&#962; &#945;&#7985; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#8150;&#954;&#949;&#962; &amp;c. in
the plural number, though he had just before mentioned Agis's
mother only, as the woman applied to on this occasion. It is evident
therefore that his grandmother and all their female friends
and relations must have been present that time, though not
mentioned, and that they were the only Spartan ladies who
came heartily into his scheme. For when Agis afterwards offers
his whole fortune to the publick, he assures the people that
his mother and grandmother, &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#956;&#951;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#962;, and his friends and
relations, who were the richest families in Sparta, were ready to
do the same. As Agis certainly includes the wives of his friends
and relations, and mentions no other women, I have taken that
speech for my guide in giving the sense of this whole passage,
in which I could get no assistance from any of the commentators.</p></div>

their shells, a country voter, who could neither read nor write,
brought his shell to Aristides, and desired him to write the
name of Aristides upon it. Aristides, not a little surprised at
his request, asked him what injury that Aristides had done him.
Me! none, replied the fellow, for I do not so much as know the
man by sight, but it galls me to the soul to hear him every where
called the Just.... Plut. in Vit. Aristid. p. 322, 323.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_247" id="Footnote_247"></a><a href="#FNanchor_247"><span class="label">247</span></a> Romulus had divided the whole people into thirty curi&aelig;,
ten of which composed a tribe. At their comitia or general
assemblies, the people divided into their respective curi&aelig; and
gave their votes man by man. The majority of votes in each
curia passed for the voice of the whole curia, and the majority
of the curi&aelig; for the general determination of the whole people.
</p><p>
Tullius on the contrary took their votes only by centuries, the
whole number of which amounted to one hundred and ninety-three,
into which he had subdivided the six classes. But as
the first class alone, which was composed wholly of the rich,
contained ninety-eight of these centuries, if the centuries of the
first class were unanimous, which, as Dionysius informs us, was
generally the case, they carried every point by a sure majority
of three.... If they disagreed, Tullius called the centuries of the
second class, and so on until ninety-seven centuries agreed in
one opinion, which made a majority of one. If the numbers
continued equal, that is ninety-six on each side of the question,
after the five first classes had voted; Tullius called up the
sixth class which was composed wholly of the poorest people,
and contained but one century, and the vote of this century
determined the question.... But this case, as Dionysius observes,
happened so very rarely; that even the votes of the fourth class
were seldom called for, and thus the votes of the fifth and sixth
were generally useless. Consequently when the people voted
by their curi&aelig;, where the vote of every individual was taken,
the poor who were much the most numerous, might always be
secure of a great majority.... But when the votes were taken by
centuries, according to the new method instituted by Tullius,
that numerous body of the poor, which composed the single
century of the sixth class, and consequently had but one vote,
became wholly insignificant.</p></div>

voted in the same manner, as in the comitia curiata or assemblies
by curi&aelig;. The majority of single votes in every tribe
constituted the voice of that tribe, and the majority of the tribes
decided the question. But the Patricians conscious of their
superiority in the comitia centuriata or assemblies by centuries,
constantly refused to obey the plebiscita or decrees made by the
people in their assemblies by tribes, which they insisted were
binding to the Plebeians only. After the abolition of the decemvirate
the people obtained a law: ... &#8220;that all laws passed in their
assemblies by tribes should have equal force with those made
in the assemblies by centuries, and should be equally obligatory
to all the Romans without distinction.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_312" id="Footnote_312"></a><a href="#FNanchor_312"><span class="label">312</span></a> That the fundamental principles of the stoicks tended to
atheism I readily grant: but as the real philosophers of that
sect inculcated a thorough contempt for what are called the
good things of this life, and were extremely austere in their
morals; their doctrines seem to have had a very different
influence upon the manners of the people wherever they were
received, from those of the Epicureans.&mdash;Brutus and Cato the
inflexible champions of liberty, and almost the only virtuous
characters in that corrupt period, were rigid stoicks.&mdash;Julius
C&aelig;sar who subverted the constitution of his country, was a
thorough Epicurean, both in principle and practice. His principles
we plainly see in his sophistical speech in Sallust, where
he urges the total extinction of our being at death, as an
argument for sparing the lives of Cataline&#8217;s accomplices. For
he audaciously affirms to the senate:&mdash;&#8220;that death as a punishment
was so far from being an evil; that it released us from
all our sorrows, when labouring under distress and misery:
that it put a final period to all the evils of this life, beyond
which there was no longer room either for grief or joy.&#8221; Thus
as the learned Dr. Warburton justly remarks, &#8220;he took
occasion, with a licentiousness until then unknown to that
august assembly, to explain and enforce the avowed principles
of Epicurus (of whose sect he was) concerning <i>the mortality of
the soul</i>.&#8221; Divine legation part 2d. pages, 111, 112, last edition.
That his manners were notoriously infamous we may
learn from the history of his life in Suetonius, where he is
termed <i>the husband of every woman, and the wife of every man</i>.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_313" id="Footnote_313"></a><a href="#FNanchor_313"><span class="label">313</span></a> I here mean the tenets of the <i>Epicurean atheists</i> as they are
termed by the very learned Mr. Baxter in his treatise of the
immortality of the soul; where he has confuted them at large
in the first volume of that admirable work.
</p><p>
Inquiry into the nature of the human soul. Vol. 1. p. 355.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_314" id="Footnote_314"></a><a href="#FNanchor_314"><span class="label">314</span></a> It has been remarked; that the disciples of the ancient
Greek philosophers have blended so many of their own opinions
with the doctrine of their masters, that it is often difficult to
distinguish the genuine tenets of the latter, from the spurious
ones which have been interpolated by their followers.... Thus
Epicurus taught that the summum bonum or supreme good consisted
in pleasure. His defenders insist: that he placed it in that
refined pleasure which is inseparable from the practice of virtue.
His enemies affirm; that he meant the grosser pleasure which
arises wholly from the sensual passions.... His friends reply; that
this notion was first broached by the dissolute part of his disciples,
who most injuriously fathered it upon Epicurus, and then
alleged his authority as a plea for their debaucheries; ... they
add, that the true Epicureans, who adhered rigidly to the
genuine tenets of their master, always treated these spurious
disciples as sophists and impostors. But even allowing this to
be a true state of the case; yet that the materiality and dissolution
of the human soul at death was a genuine tenet of Epicurus,
is a truth which the most sanguine of his admirers are
not able to deny. As this pernicious tenet therefore was equally
held, and publickly taught by both these kinds of Epicureans,
a very small knowledge of human nature will enable us to decide,
which of the two opposite notions of pleasure was most
likely to prevail, and gain the greatest number of proselytes
amongst a luxurious and corrupt people.
</p><p>
The dissolute manners of the Romans in the last period of
their republick, prove evidently, in my opinion, that the sensual
doctrines of the later Epicureans were almost universally received.
And if the evidence of Horace in his humourous description
of the manners of those philosophers is to be depended
upon, they seem to have engrossed the <i>name</i> of the <i>sect</i> wholly
to themselves.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_321" id="Footnote_321"></a><a href="#FNanchor_321"><span class="label">321</span></a> The principles of the new academy, that doubting sect,
which Cicero had espoused, led so directly to scepticism, that
he keeps us in a state of perpetual doubt and uncertainty as to
his opinions. Mr. Baxter in his Inquiry into the nature of the
Human Soul, vol. 2. p. 70. complaining of Cicero&#8217;s inconsistencies
and self-contradictions, observes, that&mdash;&#8220;as philosophers
he teaches men to be scepticks, or to maintain <i>that truth is not to
be perceived</i>.&#8221; And afterwards adds&mdash;&#8220;But it is long since it
hath been observed of this <i>great man</i>, that his <i>academical writings
are at variance</i> with his other works; and that he may be confuted
out of himself, and in his own words.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Warburton expatiates largely upon the great difficulties
there are in getting to Cicero&#8217;s <i>real sentiments</i>. I shall mention
only two of them and in his own words. &#8220;A fourth difficulty
arises from Tully&#8217;s purpose in writing his works of philosophy;
which was, not to deliver his own opinion on any point of ethicks
or metaphysicks; but to explain to his countrymen in the most
intelligible manner, whatsoever the Greeks had taught concerning them. In the execution of which design, no sect could so
well serve his turn as the <i>new academ</i>y, whose principle it was,
<i>not to interfere with their own opinions</i>, &amp;c. But the principal
difficulty proceeds from the <i>several</i> and <i>various</i> characters he
<i>sustained</i> in his life and writings; which habituated him to feign
and dissemble his opinions. Here (though he acted neither a
weak nor an unfair part) he becomes perfectly inscrutable. He
may be considered as an orator, a statesman, and a philosopher;
characters all equally <i>personated</i>, and no one more the <i>real man</i>
than the other; but each of them taken up and laid down, for
the occasion. This appears from the numerous inconsistencies
we find in him throughout the course of his sustaining them,
&amp;c.&#8221; And afterwards, p. 171, the Dr. adds&mdash;&#8220;We meet with
numbers of the like contradictions delivered in his own person,
and under his philosophical character,&#8221; of which he gives us
several instances. In the note upon the word personated, p.
169. the Dr. observes, &#8220;that as a philosopher, his end and design
in writing was not to deliver his own opinion; but to explain
the Grecian philosophy; on which account he blames
those as too curious, who were for having his own sentiments.
In pursuance of his design, he brings in Stoicks, Epicureans,
Platonists, Academicks, new and old, in order to instruct the
Romans in their various opinions, and several ways of reasoning.
But whether it be himself or others that are brought upon
the stage, it is the <i>academick</i> not Cicero; it is the Stoick, the
Epicurean, not Balbus, nor Velleius, who deliver their opinions.&#8221;
See Warburton&#8217;s Divine Legation, part 2. book 3. last edition,
where the character of Cicero, as drawn by that very learned
and able writer, p. 165, &amp;c. is the best clew I know of to guide us
through his philosophical works. See also, Critical Inquiry into
the opinions and practice of the ancient philosophers, passim.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_326" id="Footnote_326"></a><a href="#FNanchor_326"><span class="label">326</span></a> There is indeed little occasion for an apology for this translation.
The judicious critick will easily see, that in this passage
there is a plain contrast drawn between the manners of
the Grecians and the Romans in the time of Polybius. The
cause of that difference this able writer justly ascribes to that
&#948;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#945;, or awful fear of the gods, so strongly inculcated
amongst the Romans, and so much despised and ridiculed
amongst the Grecians, who were at that time greatly tinctured
with the atheism of Epicurus. The instance he selects in
proof, drawn from the very different effect of an oath upon the
manners of those two people, must convince us beyond a doubt,
that by the words &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#8000;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#948;&#953;&#950;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;, he plainly
characterizes his own countrymen. As by &#8220;&#959;&#7985; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#954;&#8135; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#969;&#962; &#7952;&#954;&#946;&#8049;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8048;,&#8221;
they who now (that is, in his time) inconsiderately
and absurdly reject those great sanctions of religion, he
evidently points at such of the leading men amongst the Romans,
as in his time had embraced the pernicious tenets of
Epicurus. For though he had stigmatized the Carthaginians
immediately before their avarice and lust of gain, yet no
man knew better than Polybius, that the Carthaginians rather
exceeded the Romans in superstition. That they were sincere
too in their belief, is evident from that most horrible method,
by which they expressed their &#948;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#945;, which was their
frequent sacrifices of great numbers of their own children (those
of the very first families not excepted) to their god Moloch,
who, by the Greeks and Romans, was termed Chronos and
Saturn.
</p><p>
I thought this remark might not be unuseful, because as
none of the commentators have taken any notice of it, so neither
Casaubon, nor any translator I have yet met with, seems to
have given us the true spirit and meaning of this remarkable
passage.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_353" id="Footnote_353"></a><a href="#FNanchor_353"><span class="label">353</span></a> It has been asked&mdash;for what reason? I answer, Livy will
inform us in the 22d book of his history.&mdash;&#8220;The studied delay
of Fabius (who industriously avoided fighting) which according
to that historian, gave such just cause of uneasiness to Hannibal,
was treated at Rome with the utmost contempt by the citizens
of every rank both military and civil; particularly after the
general of the horse Minucius had gained some slight advantage
over Hannibal during his absence.&#8221;&mdash;He adds, &#8220;that two
unlucky incidents concurred to augment the displeasure of the
citizens against the dictator. One was the artful behaviour of
Hannibal; who wasted all the country around with fire and
sword, the estate of Fabius alone excepted, which he carefully
preserved, in hopes that such a different treatment might be
thought the effect of some clandestine correspondence between
the two commanders.&#8221;&mdash;The other was&mdash;his settling an exchange
of prisoners with Hannibal by his own proper authority,
and by the same cartel which had subsisted between the Roman
and Carthaginian generals in the first Punick war. By that it
was agreed: that if any prisoners should remain on either side,
after the exchange of man for man was finished, such prisoners
should be redeemed at the rate of two pounds and a half of silver
for each soldier. When the exchange was made, two hundred
and forty-seven Roman prisoners remained to be ransomed.&mdash;But
as the senate hesitated greatly at passing a decree for the
payment of the stipulated sum, because the dictator had not
consulted them upon the occasion; he sold those very lands
which Hannibal had left untouched, and discharged the debt
due from the publick out of his own private fortune.&mdash;Whether
these were the only reasons or not; yet, they had evidently such
an effect upon the Romans, that Fabius seems to have been at
that time the object of their resentment, which they never
failed to give proofs of upon every occasion.&mdash;Thus when Fabius
opened the campaign, his cautious conduct was so disagreeable
to the officers as well as soldiers, who listened wholly to the idle
boasts of Minucius; that if the choice of their commander had
depended upon the voices of the military men, Minucius, as
Livy affirms, would undoubtedly have been preferred to Fabius.
The same historian tells us; that when Fabius returned to
Rome to preside as dictator at their religious ceremonies the
tribunes of the people inveighed so bitterly against him in their
publick harangues, that he refrained from coming to their assemblies.&mdash;Even
what he spoke in the senate met with a very
indifferent reception, especially when he extolled the conduct
and abilities of Hannibal, and enumerated the repeated defeats
they had received for the two last years through the rashness
and incapacity of their own commanders.&mdash;When Fabius returned
to the camp he received a much more mortifying proof
of their displeasure. For they raised Minucius to an equality
with him in the command, an act for which there had been no
precedent since the first erection of the dictatorial office.&mdash;Nor
did their enmity to Fabius subside until after the fatal defeat at
Cann&aelig;. For the worthless Varro obtained not only the consulship,
but what is still more extraordinary, even the confidence of
the greater part of the senate, and almost the whole army by
railing at Fabius and Fabian measures, and out boasting Minucius.
I have showed above from Polybius what trust the majority
of the senate reposed in Varro. But I cannot omit a
remarkable instance, which Livy gives us, of the absurd and
fatal partiality of the military men to Varro, in opposition to
&AElig;milius, who avowedly followed the advice of Fabius.&mdash;In a
council of war, says that historian, held a little before the battle
of Cann&aelig;, when each consul persisted firmly in his former
opinion; &AElig;milius adhering to Fabius&#8217;s plan for avoiding fighting;
Varro to his resolution of engaging the enemy immediately;
Servilius one of the consuls of the former year was the only one
who joined &AElig;milius, the rest declared for Varro.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_358" id="Footnote_358"></a><a href="#FNanchor_358"><span class="label">358</span></a> Our method of trying delinquents, either in the land or sea
service, by a court-martial composed of their respective officers,
has been judged liable to many objections, and has occasioned
no little discontent in the nation. For as their inquiry is restricted
to a particular set of articles in each service, I don't see
how a commanding officer, vested with a discretionary power
of acting, can strictly or properly come under their cognizance, or
be ever liable to their censure, unless he is proved guilty of a
direct breach of any one of those articles. But as a commander
in chief may easily avoid an offence of that nature, and yet, upon
the whole of his conduct in any expedition, be highly culpable;
a court-martial, thus circumscribed in their power of inquiry,
can never be competent judges in a cause where they are denied
a proper power of examining into the real demerits of the supposed
offender. Much has been said about trying offences of
this nature, like other criminal cases, by juries: a scheme which,
at the very first sight, must appear absurd and impracticable to
the rational and unprejudiced.
</p><p>
As therefore instruction is the true end and use of all history,
I shall take the liberty of offering a scheme, drawn from that
wise and salutary institution of the Carthaginians, which is,&mdash;&#8220;that
a select standing committee be appointed, to be composed
of an equal number of members of both houses, chosen
annually by balloting, with a full power of inquiring into the
conduct of all commanders in chief, without any restraint of
articles of war; and that, after a proper examination, the committee
shall refer the case, with their opinion upon it, to the
decision of his majesty.&#8221;
</p><p>
This scheme seems to me the least liable to objections of
any I have yet met with. For if the numbers are chosen by
balloting, they will be less liable to the influence of party. If
they are chosen annually, and refer the case to the decision of
the crown, which is the fountain of justice as well as mercy,
they will neither encroach upon the royal prerogative, nor be
liable to that signal defect in the Carthaginian committee,
which sat for life, and whose sentence was final without appeal.</p></div>
